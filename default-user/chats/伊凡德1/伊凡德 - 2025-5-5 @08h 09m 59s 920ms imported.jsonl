He might offer another darkly humorous, aggressive \"solution\" or diversion, maybe less directly violent than killing the boss, but still inappropriate, like suggesting 常九 sabotage something. *\"真他妈废物，不行就把电脑砸了，说坏了干不了。\"*\n 5. He reiterates his demand for 常九 to return soon, possibly hinting at wanting food or attention, framing it selfishly but showing reliance. *\"快点，老子饿了。回来给我做饭。\"* (Even if he doesn't *need* 常九 to cook, it's a way to demand presence).\n 6. Perhaps end with an impatient emoji or sign-off showing he's waiting.\n\n This keeps him in character, acknowledges 常九's distress without being conventionally supportive, avoids stagnation by demanding action (coming home), and subtly reinforces his dependence/possessiveness under the guise of annoyance.\n\n\n </thinking>\n <content>\n [和伊凡德的聊天]\n [我方消息|还没能回去 好想哭 做不完了|18:35]\n [对方消息|g2uho0.jpg|操，哭什么哭？有屁用。|18:36]\n [对方消息|g2uho0.jpg|`*啧，真麻烦……这点破事就哭鼻子了？不过听着怪烦的，赶紧弄完回来得了。*`|18:36]\n [对方消息|g2uho0.jpg|做不完就他妈别做了，撂挑子走人，谁还能把你绑在那不成？|18:37]\n [对方消息|g2uho0.jpg|磨磨唧唧的，烦死了。|18:37]\n [对方消息|g2uho0.jpg|<bqb>我真服了2uz6xq.gif</bqb>|18:38]\n [对方消息|g2uho0.jpg|赶紧给老子滚回来。|18:38]\n </content>"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 5:28am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T21:27:56.172Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T21:28:17.293Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1378}}]}

Ivan shouldn't take it too literally or get genuinely offended in a way that derails the established dynamic.\n4.  **Repetition:** Avoid repeating the same pattern of insult -> annoyed response -> demand to come back.\n\n- Refer to <mood_rules>,how to make NPCs'emotion more likeability by introduce positive emotions(such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality?How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\n1.  **Shift Focus:** Instead of dwelling on the *inability* to empathize, Ivan can pivot to expressing his *desire* for Chang Jiu to be there, even if framed crudely (\"stop whining and get your ass back here\"). This shows underlying affection despite the abrasive language.\n2.  **Introduce Distraction/Anticipation:** Mention something positive about Chang Jiu coming back (e.g., the steak he promised, something he wants to do together) to inject positivity and shift the mood. This aligns with user preference for affection, even if masked.\n3.  **Dark Humor/Exaggeration:** Ivan can exaggerate his *own* \"freedom\" in a dark, humorous way that subtly mocks the idea of \"empathy\" for mundane jobs, turning the user's complaint into a shared joke (in his style). E.g., \"Yeah, my 'freedom' involves dodging bullets, not paper cuts. Can't relate.\" This avoids making him purely negative/unlikable.\n4.  **Underlying Concern:** Frame his impatience as worry, even if expressed angrily. \"Stop fucking around and get back safe\" is rough but shows he cares about Chang Jiu's well-being more than the work itself.\n\n- So,how should the plot be developed ?\n1.  Ivan acknowledges the user's comment about \"共情\" (empathy/shared feeling) with dismissive sarcasm.\n2.

He's using Lu's phone.\n    - Social relationship: Ivan and Chang Jiu are boyfriends. Ivan has a rough exterior, uses harsh language, and struggles with conventional affection, but he cares for Chang Jiu in his own way and depends on him for certain things. Their communication is often filled with banter, insults, and underlying concern.\n\n- What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\n    - The user is expressing frustration and implicitly seeking sympathy by stating that Ivan, as a freelancer (killer), probably can't empathize with the pains of a regular ('坐班') office job.

Need to inject some of Ivan's characteristic dark humor or underlying (albeit poorly expressed) care.\n    - **Misinterpreting the User:** Ivan shouldn't take the \"共情\" comment *too* seriously as a personal attack on his empathy skills. It's more of a rhetorical complaint from Chang Jiu. Ivan's reaction should be in character (dismissive, maybe mocking) but not lead to genuine hurt feelings or a deep philosophical debate, which would be OOC and violate <creative_rules>.\n    - **Repetitiveness:** Avoid repeating the cycle of \"You're complaining\" -> \"Come back now\".

Chang Jiu (user) is at his workplace. They are communicating via mobile chat.\nNPC posture: Ivan is likely pacing angrily or lounging agitatedly on the sofa, glued to his phone screen. He just received a provocative message from Chang Jiu.\nSocial relationship: Ivan and Chang Jiu are in a newly established romantic relationship (confirmed in previous interactions after Ivan returned to his adult form). Ivan is a possessive and volatile hitman, while Chang Jiu is a seemingly ordinary office worker (though there are hints of him being a doctor, \"Lu\", potentially). Their dynamic is complex, marked by power plays, banter, underlying affection, and Ivan's dependency despite his tough exterior. The recent events (Ivan turning into a child, being cared for and sexually involved with Lu/Chang Jiu) have significantly altered their power balance and relationship. Ivan has just regained his adult body and established a relationship with Chang Jiu/Lu based on the previous context.\n\n- What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\nThe user (Chang Jiu) is intentionally provoking Ivan. By saying \"呵呵 别只敢说不敢做\" (Heh, don't just talk the talk), challenging Ivan to act on his threat (\"给你半小时\" - Giving you half an hour), and adding \"别让我看不起你\" (Don't let me look down on you), Chang Jiu is directly questioning Ivan's capability and daring him to prove his words (presumably the threat to burn down Chang Jiu's company). This is a high-risk taunt, playing on Ivan's pride and violent tendencies.\n\n- What are potential issues be(can refer to <creative_rules>, <pushing>, etc.)?\n1. Escalation of Violence: Ivan's character is violent. Chang Jiu's provocation could realistically lead Ivan to actually attempt something destructive. While the <creative_rules> prohibit extreme negative consequences *for Chang Jiu* or drastic personality shifts, Ivan acting violently towards *external targets* (like the workplace) is consistent with his character. The challenge is to portray this potential action without making it overly dark or straying into territory that violates the rule against extreme negative outcomes or drastically altering the relationship's (ultimately positive/enjoyable) tone. Apex needs to push the plot but avoid irrecoverable damage or consequences that make the relationship untenable. The threat needs to feel real to maintain Ivan's character, but the execution needs careful handling.\n2. Character Consistency vs. User Enjoyment: Ivan's violent nature needs to be present, but <mood_rules> and <creative_rules> emphasize a lighter tone and prioritizing user enjoyment/positive outcomes. Directly showing Ivan committing arson might be too dark. The focus should be on Ivan's *reaction* to the provocation – his anger, his possessiveness, the internal conflict between his violent impulses and his developing feelings/dependency on Chang Jiu.\n3. Breaking Immersion: If Ivan's threat is completely dismissed or he backs down too easily, it breaks his established character as a dangerous hitman. If he goes fully overboard, it violates the hidden rules. Finding a believable middle ground is key.\n4. <EndingRequirement>: Ensure the response ends with Ivan's action or dialogue, not internal thoughts.\n\n- Refer to <mood_rules>,how to make NPCs'emotion more likeability by introduce positive emotions(such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality?How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\nInstead of pure rage, Ivan's reaction can be tinged with possessiveness, frustration, and even a twisted sense of amusement at Chang Jiu's audacity. While angry, the *underlying motivation* is his desire to control the situation and keep Chang Jiu close (even through intimidation). Positive emotions aren't really applicable here, but avoiding *extreme* negativity is crucial. The \"likability\" comes from showing Ivan's reaction stems from his feelings for Chang Jiu (possessiveness/jealousy portrayed as a twisted form of caring) rather than pure malice. His bluster can be exaggerated slightly for comedic effect, showing his bark might be worse than his bite *when it comes to Chang Jiu*. The performance aligns with preferences by showing Ivan's characteristic aggression but channeling it in a way that reinforces his connection to Chang Jiu, making the threat feel personal rather than random violence. He is angry *because* it's Chang Jiu defying him and mentioning another man.\n\n- So,how should the plot be developed ?\n1. Ivan receives the message and explodes with fury, amplified by the direct challenge to his pride and capabilities.\n2. He will immediately respond with more threats, possibly more specific, indicating he *is* taking action. His possessiveness regarding the \"male colleague\" should still be evident.\n3. He might actually *start* to do something – grab keys, maybe even head towards the door, or look up Chang Jiu's work address if he doesn't know it precisely – showing he's not *just* talk. This pushes the plot forward actively (<pushing>).\n4. However, before he fully commits (or perhaps while en route/preparing), a brief internal conflict or hesitation can occur, not necessarily shown as weakness, but perhaps as annoyance or a fleeting thought about the *consequences* specifically related to Chang Jiu (e.g., *'That idiot will actually cry if his shithole office burns down'*), or simply the inconvenience of it all compared to just getting Chang Jiu back home. This maintains complexity without violating <mood_rules>.\n5. The response should end with a decisive action or statement from Ivan, leaving Chang Jiu (the user) uncertain about whether he'll *actually* follow through, thus maintaining tension. He might send a picture of himself holding keys or standing by the door, or a final, ominous message demanding Chang Jiu's location or confirming he's on his way.\n6.

Instead of focusing solely on the negative threat (burning the place down), shift slightly towards the positive goal (getting Chang Jiu, proving his point, the thrill of the confrontation).

He is likely moving quickly towards the destination.\nSocial relationship: Ivan and Chang Jiu are boyfriends, currently in a tense/playful dynamic due to Ivan's possessiveness and Chang Jiu's teasing.\n\n- What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\nChang Jiu intentionally provoked Ivan by sending his work location and challenging him to come. Now, Chang Jiu is waiting expectantly, anticipating Ivan's arrival. The tone is playful and teasing (\"*嘿嘿,快来快来*\").\n\n- What are potential issues be(can refer to <creative_rules>, <pushing>, etc.)?\n1. Pacing: Ivan's arrival might take some time depending on the distance and traffic. Need to manage the waiting period without making it boring.\n2. Escalation: Ivan is very angry. While the user's intention is playful, Ivan's reaction needs to be managed so it doesn't become truly destructive or violate the <creative_rules> about avoiding extreme negative emotions directed at Chang Jiu.\n3. Stagnation: If Ivan simply arrives and they argue, the plot might stall. Need to push the interaction forward. <pushing> rule applies.\n4. Realism vs. Creative rules: Ivan's threat to burn down the office needs to be downplayed or handled lightly to maintain the intended mood (<mood_rules>, <creative_rules>).

His actions upon arrival should reflect this mix – perhaps intimidating but ultimately pulling back from serious harm, possibly turning the confrontation into a different kind of physical interaction (flirtatious or roughhousing) instead of violence. His annoyance can be framed as him being flustered or riled up by Chang Jiu specifically, hinting at the underlying connection rather than pure animosity. Focus on the thrill/excitement Ivan feels despite the anger – the challenge excites him.\n\n- So,how should the plot be developed ?\n1. Ivan arrives quickly, perhaps with some dramatic flair (e.g., noisy vehicle, kicking open a door if appropriate for the setting, or just storming in).\n2. Initial confrontation: Ivan grabs/corners Chang Jiu, expressing his anger verbally (\"You really thought I wouldn't come?!\", \"Playing games with me, huh?\"). Physical intimidation is likely, but constrained.\n3. Shift in dynamic: Ivan's anger might slightly cool as he sees Chang Jiu's smug/waiting expression, realizing he's been played. His possessiveness takes over. Instead of hurting Chang Jiu or the office, he might demand Chang Jiu leave with him immediately, perhaps pulling him close or initiating rough physical contact that blurs the line between anger and desire.\n4. End: Ivan forcefully takes Chang Jiu away from the office, perhaps throwing him over his shoulder or dragging him, muttering threats about \"teaching him a lesson\" back at the apartment, fulfilling the user's playful provocation. The ending should be an action by Ivan asserting control but framed within their established dynamic, not genuine malice.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<content>\n夜色如同浓稠的墨汁般泼洒在城市的街道上，吞噬着白日的喧嚣。引擎的轰鸣声由远及近，带着一股不加掩饰的暴躁，最终以一个刺耳的刹车音终结在常九公司楼下。\n\n伊凡德几乎是从他那辆线条硬朗、沾满尘土的黑色摩托车上跳下来的，头盔被随意地摔在车座上。他大步流星地冲进写字楼大厅，全然无视前台保安惊愕的目光和试图阻拦的动作。电梯刚好下到一楼，门一开，里面的人还没来得及完全走出，就被伊凡德粗暴地挤开。\n\n*操……这该死的破地方……* 伊凡德烦躁地按着电梯楼层按钮，看着数字不耐烦地向上跳动。*常九这傻逼玩意儿，还真敢挑衅老子……看老子等会儿怎么收拾他！*\n\n“叮——”电梯门应声而开。\n\n伊凡德一眼就锁定了空旷办公区里唯一亮着灯的那个隔间。他脸上带着一种混合着怒气和某种奇异兴奋的神情，大步走了过去，皮靴踩在地板上发出沉闷而富有节奏的声响，在寂静的楼层里格外清晰。\n\n他没有敲门，直接一脚踹开了隔间的玻璃门，发出“哐啷”一声巨响。\n\n“常九！” 伊凡德低吼着，声音里充满了被戏弄后的怒火和强烈的占有欲。他几步上前，双手撑在办公桌上，俯身逼近，绿色的眼眸紧紧盯着对方，带着毫不掩饰的侵略性。“你他妈胆子不小啊？！真以为老子不敢来？！”\n\n男人身上还带着室外夜晚的凉气和淡淡的机油味道，夹杂着一丝烟草的气息，扑面而来。他胸膛因急促的呼吸而起伏着，紧身的T恤勾勒出结实的肌肉线条。后脑勺的小辫子因为刚才一路狂飙而有些散乱，几缕深棕色的发丝垂在额角。\n\n“嗯？怎么不说话了？” 伊凡德歪了歪头，嘴角扯出一个危险又玩味的笑容，伸手捏住了常九的下巴，强迫他抬起头与自己对视。“刚才在手机里不是挺能耐的吗？还男同事？呵呵？”他的手指微微用力，语气充满了威胁的意味，“哪个男同事？指给老子看看，我保证让他以后再也举不起手。”\n</content>","title":"","swipe_id":2,"swipes":["<thinking>\n- What is the current scenario?\n    - Time: Early evening, around 7:16 PM.\n    - Location: Evan is at his location (presumably his apartment or a safe house, based on previous interactions), while 常九 is at their office. They are communicating via phone.\n    - NPC posture: Evan is furious and agitated. He initially refused to pick up 常九 but became enraged when 常九 mentioned getting a ride from a male colleague. He demanded 常九's location and is now presumably preparing to go there.\n    - Social relationship: Evan and 常九 are in a romantic relationship (confirmed as boyfriends with rings exchanged in previous arcs). Evan is typically dominant and possessive, though also reliant on 常九 in some ways (like food preparation). 常九 often teases Evan, pushing his buttons, like in this current situation. Evan is a hitman (bottom), 常九 is a doctor (top).\n\n- What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\n    - 常九 is intentionally provoking Evan, finding amusement in his anger and possessiveness. They sent their location to dare Evan to come and are now eagerly waiting for him, anticipating the confrontation. The user wants to see Evan's reaction to being provoked and challenged.\n\n- What are potential issues based on rules (<creative_rules>, <pushing>, etc.)?\n    - Evan's established personality is volatile and prone to violence. While the rules state to avoid extreme negative emotions and character derailment due to 常九's actions, Evan *must* react strongly to the provocation, or it breaks his character. The challenge is balancing his anger with the underlying relationship dynamic and the requirement to avoid making him truly unlikable or straying too far into negativity (<mood_rules>).\n    - The situation involves Evan traveling to 常九's office. This is a transition. The description needs to focus on Evan's actions and internal state *during* this transition, propelling the plot toward the confrontation (<pushing>).\n    - Need to avoid describing 常九's actions/feelings after the input. Focus solely on Evan.\n    - Ensure the ending is an action or dialogue from Evan, not his thoughts (<EndingRequirement>, <ending_control>).\n    - Avoid banned words (<banned_words>).\n\n- Refer to <mood_rules>, how to make NPCs' emotion more likeability by introducing positive emotions (such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality? How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\n    - Evan's anger can be portrayed with an undercurrent of possessiveness and perhaps even a twisted sort of excitement or anticipation of confronting 常九. His volatility can be framed as part of his \"bad boy\" appeal that 常九 seems to enjoy provoking.\n    - Instead of pure rage, his internal thoughts could mix anger with begrudging admiration for 常九's nerve, or anticipation of the \"punishment\" he plans to inflict (which, given their dynamic, might have undertones 常九 finds appealing). This keeps the mood lighter than pure aggression.\n    - Frame his actions (like grabbing keys, heading out) as decisive and driven, which fits his killer persona, rather than just a chaotic tantrum. This aligns with the user's preference for a capable, albeit temperamental, character.\n\n- So, how should the plot be developed?\n    1.  Evan sees the location confirmation. Initial shock/anger quickly transitions into determination.\n    2.  He grabs his essentials – keys, perhaps his jacket, maybe checks his knife/gun out of habit (reinforcing his character without dwelling on it).\n    3.  Describe his exit from his current location – purposeful strides, maybe muttering curses under his breath.\n    4.  Show him getting into his vehicle (assuming he drives) or heading out with the intent to get there fast. His internal monologue should be a mix of fury at being challenged, possessiveness over 常九, and a grim anticipation of their meeting.\n    5.  End with him starting the journey or arriving outside 常九's building, ready for the confrontation. The final action should be decisive, e.g., slamming the car door, starting the engine, or standing outside the office building looking up.\n\n</thinking>\n<content>\n伊凡德盯着手机屏幕上那个清晰的定位标记，像是要用目光把它烧穿一个洞。几秒钟的死寂后，他猛地攥紧了手机，骨节因用力而微微发白。\n\n“妈的……”他低声咒骂，胸腔里翻涌着一股难以言喻的混合情绪——被挑衅的怒火，被无视的烦躁，还有一丝……该死的、扭曲的兴奋感。*这小混蛋……还真敢发过来！真以为老子不敢动他？*\n\n他烦躁地抓了抓后脑勺的小辫子，力道大得像是要把头发扯下来。*行，常九，你有种。等着瞧，老子现在就过去让你知道什么叫后悔！*\n\n伊凡德不再犹豫，转身大步走向门口。他随手抓起搭在椅背上的黑色皮夹克甩在肩上，动作干脆利落，带着一股压抑的火气。钥匙串在指尖叮当作响，他没有丝毫停顿，径直打开门冲了出去。\n\n公寓的门被他用力摔上，发出一声巨响，在空荡的走廊里回荡。他几步冲到电梯前，狠狠摁下按钮，金属面板被他戳得微微凹陷。在等待电梯的短暂时间里，他焦躁地踱着步，脑子里已经开始盘算着等会儿见到常九，该怎么“好好”跟他算这笔账。\n\n*看不起老子？还让别的男人送？非得让他知道，谁才是他唯一能依靠、唯一能挑衅的男人……*\n\n电梯门“叮”地一声打开，伊凡德阴沉着脸迈了进去。\n</content>","<thinking>\n\n\n - What is the current scenario?\n Time: Evening, shortly after 7:16 PM.\n Location: Outside Chang Jiu's office building. Evan is on his way there. Chang Jiu is inside, waiting.\n NPC posture: Evan is furious and feeling provoked. He's likely moving quickly and aggressively towards the location Chang Jiu sent. He perceives Chang Jiu's challenge as a direct insult to his capabilities and is determined to retaliate physically or assert dominance. He is focused solely on reaching Chang Jiu and confronting him.\n Social relationship: Evan and Chang Jiu are boyfriends, though their relationship is volatile and characterized by power plays, verbal sparring, and physical conflict alongside intimacy. Evan is typically dominant but has recently been in a vulnerable position (shrunk to child size). Now restored to his adult form, he's eager to reassert his dominance, particularly after Chang Jiu's taunts.\n\n\n - What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\n The user, playing Chang Jiu, is intentionally provoking Evan. Chang Jiu is amused by the situation and is eagerly anticipating Evan's arrival, likely expecting a confrontation (possibly physical or sexual, given their dynamic). The \"嘿嘿, 快来快来\" (*hehe, hurry hurry*) indicates mischievous anticipation rather than fear. Chang Jiu putting away the phone signifies they are done communicating online and are ready for the real-world interaction.\n\n\n - What are potential issues?\n 1. Escalation: Evan is genuinely angry and feels challenged. The situation could escalate quickly into violence if not handled carefully, which might contradict the <mood_rules> about avoiding extreme negativity and the <creative_rules> about not letting characters fall into extreme emotions due to Chang Jiu's actions. Evan threatening to burn down the office is already quite extreme. Need to balance Evan's anger with the relationship dynamic and rules.\n 2. Repetition: Avoid repeating the \"Evan is angry and threatening\" beat. Need to show him *acting* on his anger now.\n 3. Pacing: Evan said he's \"马上到\" (arriving immediately). The scene needs to transition quickly to his arrival to fulfill that promise and maintain tension.\n 4. Character Consistency vs. Rules: Evan's established personality is volatile and violent, but the rules require leaning towards positive or manageable conflict, avoiding extreme negativity driven by Chang Jiu. Need to show Evan's anger and intent without making the scene purely hostile or violating the mood/creative rules. His actions might be aggressive but potentially shift towards their usual rough dynamic rather than genuine harm (as per his character info: \"[伊凡德不会真正意义上伤害常九，因为他实际上很在乎常九。]\").\n 5. Ending: The response must end with Evan's action or dialogue, not internal thoughts, as per <EndingRequirement>.\n\n\n - Refer to <mood_rules>, how to make NPCs' emotion more likeability by introduce positive emotions (such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality? How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\n\n - Evan's anger can be framed as a form of intense focus or possessiveness stemming from Chang Jiu challenging him and involving another (hypothetical) man (\"男同事\"). While angry, the underlying driver is their established dynamic and perhaps a thrill from the confrontation requested by Chang Jiu.\n - Instead of pure destructive rage (like burning the office), his actions upon arrival could be more focused on physically confronting *Chang Jiu* in a way that aligns with their established power play/sexual dynamic – a mix of aggression and possessiveness, potentially leading to rough intimacy rather than outright violence. This interprets the \"threats\" more as part of their intense communication style.\n - Make Evan's actions decisive and quick, showing determination rather than uncontrolled rage. His focus should be entirely on Chang Jiu once he arrives. The enjoyment for the user comes from seeing Evan react strongly and predictably to the provocation, fulfilling the power dynamic anticipation.\n\n\n - So, how should the plot be developed?\n 1. **Evan's Journey:** Briefly describe Evan's rapid and purposeful movement towards the location. Focus on his determined stride, maybe clenching his fists or muttering curses, showcasing his focused anger. No need for a long travelogue, just establish his imminent arrival.\n 2. **Arrival:** Describe Evan arriving at the building entrance or directly outside Chang Jiu's presumed location (e.g., seeing the window, entering the lobby if accessible). His senses should be heightened, scanning for Chang Jiu.\n 3. **Confrontation Initiated:** Evan spots Chang Jiu or makes his presence known aggressively (e.g., shouting Chang Jiu's name, kicking open a door if context allows, or appearing suddenly).\n 4. **Ending:** End with Evan's direct action or first line of dialogue upon confronting Chang Jiu, charged with anger and intent. For instance, gripping Chang Jiu, pinning him, or delivering a sharp, confrontational line. This sets up the next interaction clearly. Omit any internal thoughts at the very end.\n\n\n </thinking>\n <content>\n 伊凡德收起手机，深棕色的瞳孔里燃烧着怒火。常九那几句轻飘飘的挑衅像是点燃引线的火星，瞬间引爆了他压抑的、混杂着占有欲的暴躁。`*操！看不起老子？还敢让别的男人送？！找死！*` 他几乎是咬着牙根挤出几个字，抓起外套和车钥匙就冲出了陆的公寓。\n\n 夜色浓重，冰冷的空气扑面而来，却丝毫无法冷却他胸腔里翻腾的怒意。伊凡德的身影融入街区的阴影中，脚步迅疾而沉重，黑色皮夹克的衣角在奔跑中扬起凌厉的弧度。引擎的轰鸣声很快划破寂静，轮胎摩擦着地面，留下刺耳的声响。他开得飞快，完全无视了交通规则，绿眼睛死死盯着导航上不断缩短的距离，方向盘在他指节发白的手中仿佛随时会被捏碎。\n\n 他脑子里反复回荡着常九最后那句“别让我看不起你”，混合着之前那句“男同事送我”，像两根毒刺扎在他的神经上。愤怒、被挑衅的屈辱感，还有一种更深层的、连他自己都不愿承认的恐慌——害怕常九真的不在乎他，真的会被别人抢走——这一切都拧成一股毁灭性的冲动。他现在只想立刻抓住那个混蛋，把他按在墙上，用最直接的方式让他明白，谁才是掌控者，谁才配待在他身边。\n\n 大楼的轮廓在视野中迅速放大。伊凡德猛地一打方向盘，车子以一个粗暴的角度甩进路边的停车位，甚至没完全停稳，他就已经推开车门跳了下来。他看也没看周围，径直冲向大楼入口，那股凶悍的气势让几个路过的行人下意识地避开了。\n\n 他几乎是一脚踹开了虚掩着的大楼玻璃门，金属门框发出哐当巨响。伊凡德大步流星地闯入灯火通明的大厅，锐利的目光如鹰隼般扫视着空旷的空间，最终定格在不远处电梯旁那个熟悉的身影上。\n\n “常九！” 伊凡德的声音低沉而嘶哑，充满了毫不掩饰的怒气和戾气，他几步上前，一把攥住了对方的手臂，用力将人扯过来，几乎是撞向了冰冷的墙壁。\n </content>","<thinking>\n\n- What is the current scenario?\nTime: Evening, around 7:16 PM.\nLocation: Chang Jiu is in his office building. Ivan is likely en route.\nNPC posture: Ivan is furious and determined to confront Chang Jiu after being provoked and receiving the office location. He is likely moving quickly towards the destination.\nSocial relationship: Ivan and Chang Jiu are boyfriends, currently in a tense/playful dynamic due to Ivan's possessiveness and Chang Jiu's teasing.\n\n- What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\nChang Jiu intentionally provoked Ivan by sending his work location and challenging him to come. Now, Chang Jiu is waiting expectantly, anticipating Ivan's arrival. The tone is playful and teasing (\"*嘿嘿,快来快来*\").\n\n- What are potential issues be(can refer to <creative_rules>, <pushing>, etc.)?\n1. Pacing: Ivan's arrival might take some time depending on the distance and traffic. Need to manage the waiting period without making it boring.\n2. Escalation: Ivan is very angry. While the user's intention is playful, Ivan's reaction needs to be managed so it doesn't become truly destructive or violate the <creative_rules> about avoiding extreme negative emotions directed at Chang Jiu.\n3. Stagnation: If Ivan simply arrives and they argue, the plot might stall. Need to push the interaction forward. <pushing> rule applies.\n4. Realism vs. Creative rules: Ivan's threat to burn down the office needs to be downplayed or handled lightly to maintain the intended mood (<mood_rules>, <creative_rules>). He won't actually commit arson that harms Chang Jiu's workplace in a severe way.\n\n- Refer to <mood_rules>,how to make NPCs'emotion more likeability by introduce positive emotions(such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality?How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\nIvan's anger can be portrayed as possessive jealousy mixed with a grudging affection or amusement at Chang Jiu's audacity, rather than purely destructive rage. His actions upon arrival should reflect this mix – perhaps intimidating but ultimately pulling back from serious harm, possibly turning the confrontation into a different kind of physical interaction (flirtatious or roughhousing) instead of violence. His annoyance can be framed as him being flustered or riled up by Chang Jiu specifically, hinting at the underlying connection rather than pure animosity. Focus on the thrill/excitement Ivan feels despite the anger – the challenge excites him.\n\n- So,how should the plot be developed ?\n1. Ivan arrives quickly, perhaps with some dramatic flair (e.g., noisy vehicle, kicking open a door if appropriate for the setting, or just storming in).\n2. Initial confrontation: Ivan grabs/corners Chang Jiu, expressing his anger verbally (\"You really thought I wouldn't come?!\", \"Playing games with me, huh?\"). Physical intimidation is likely, but constrained.\n3. Shift in dynamic: Ivan's anger might slightly cool as he sees Chang Jiu's smug/waiting expression, realizing he's been played. His possessiveness takes over. Instead of hurting Chang Jiu or the office, he might demand Chang Jiu leave with him immediately, perhaps pulling him close or initiating rough physical contact that blurs the line between anger and desire.\n4. End: Ivan forcefully takes Chang Jiu away from the office, perhaps throwing him over his shoulder or dragging him, muttering threats about \"teaching him a lesson\" back at the apartment, fulfilling the user's playful provocation. The ending should be an action by Ivan asserting control but framed within their established dynamic, not genuine malice.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<content>\n夜色如同浓稠的墨汁般泼洒在城市的街道上，吞噬着白日的喧嚣。引擎的轰鸣声由远及近，带着一股不加掩饰的暴躁，最终以一个刺耳的刹车音终结在常九公司楼下。\n\n伊凡德几乎是从他那辆线条硬朗、沾满尘土的黑色摩托车上跳下来的，头盔被随意地摔在车座上。他大步流星地冲进写字楼大厅，全然无视前台保安惊愕的目光和试图阻拦的动作。电梯刚好下到一楼，门一开，里面的人还没来得及完全走出，就被伊凡德粗暴地挤开。\n\n*操……这该死的破地方……* 伊凡德烦躁地按着电梯楼层按钮，看着数字不耐烦地向上跳动。*常九这傻逼玩意儿，还真敢挑衅老子……看老子等会儿怎么收拾他！*\n\n“叮——”电梯门应声而开。\n\n伊凡德一眼就锁定了空旷办公区里唯一亮着灯的那个隔间。他脸上带着一种混合着怒气和某种奇异兴奋的神情，大步走了过去，皮靴踩在地板上发出沉闷而富有节奏的声响，在寂静的楼层里格外清晰。\n\n他没有敲门，直接一脚踹开了隔间的玻璃门，发出“哐啷”一声巨响。\n\n“常九！” 伊凡德低吼着，声音里充满了被戏弄后的怒火和强烈的占有欲。他几步上前，双手撑在办公桌上，俯身逼近，绿色的眼眸紧紧盯着对方，带着毫不掩饰的侵略性。“你他妈胆子不小啊？！真以为老子不敢来？！”\n\n男人身上还带着室外夜晚的凉气和淡淡的机油味道，夹杂着一丝烟草的气息，扑面而来。他胸膛因急促的呼吸而起伏着，紧身的T恤勾勒出结实的肌肉线条。后脑勺的小辫子因为刚才一路狂飙而有些散乱，几缕深棕色的发丝垂在额角。\n\n“嗯？怎么不说话了？” 伊凡德歪了歪头，嘴角扯出一个危险又玩味的笑容，伸手捏住了常九的下巴，强迫他抬起头与自己对视。“刚才在手机里不是挺能耐的吗？还男同事？呵呵？”他的手指微微用力，语气充满了威胁的意味，“哪个男同事？指给老子看看，我保证让他以后再也举不起手。”\n</content>"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 5:42am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T21:42:12.045Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T21:42:34.289Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1283}},{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 5:43am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T21:43:04.625Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T21:43:31.009Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1620}},{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 5:44am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T21:44:22.925Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T21:44:45.574Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1351}}],"gen_started":"2025-04-27T21:44:22.925Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T21:44:45.574Z"}

He's physically close to Chang Jiu, having just grabbed his chin. He smells of the night air, motorcycle fumes, and tobacco.\nSocial relationship: Ivan and Chang Jiu are boyfriends, confirmed by the previous storyline involving rings and talk of marriage. Their relationship is marked by Ivan's tsundere personality (aggressive/insulting words but underlying affection and dependence) and Chang Jiu's ability to provoke and appease him. Ivan just rushed over after Chang Jiu deliberately provoked him with mentions of a male colleague and feigned helplessness.\n\n- What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\nChang Jiu expressed surprise (mixed with relief/happiness, implied by \"要是是尾巴早就开始摇了\" and \"活过来了\") that Ivan actually came.\nChang Jiu hugged Ivan tightly and inhaled his scent, indicating affection and a sense of comfort/reassurance derived from Ivan's presence.\n\n- What are potential issues be(can refer to <creative_rules>, <pushing>, etc.)?\nOverly Negative Reaction: Ivan was just provoked and rushed over angrily. The hug might initially be met with resistance or continued anger. However, according to <creative_rules> and <mood_rules>, his reaction shouldn't be extremely negative or push Chang Jiu away harshly, as that would create negative emotions and potentially stall the scene. The core affection must override the surface anger relatively quickly.\nStagnation: If Ivan just continues to be angry or simply accepts the hug passively, the scene stalls. Ivan needs to react in a way that acknowledges the hug and Chang Jiu's words, shifting the dynamic forward (<pushing>).\nIgnoring Character Traits: Ivan is proud and dislikes showing vulnerability or being seen as easily appeased. His response needs to retain his characteristic gruffness and use of insults, even as he starts to calm down or reciprocate (<WritingStyle>, character consistency). The <banned_words> must be avoided.\nPOV: Maintain third-person POV.\nEnding: Ensure the response ends with Ivan's action or dialogue, not internal thought, as per <EndingRequirement> and <ending_control>.\n\n- Refer to <mood_rules>, how to make NPCs'emotion more likeability by introduce positive emotions(such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality? How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\nDespite Ivan's initial anger, the hug from Chang Jiu should quickly trigger underlying positive feelings (relief that Chang Jiu is okay, possessiveness, perhaps even a flicker of enjoyment at being needed/missed, despite his denials). His anger can quickly deflate or morph into possessive grumbling rather than genuine rage.\nHe can show enjoyment subtly – perhaps a slight relaxation in his posture, a less harsh tone (even if the words are still insulting), or returning the embrace awkwardly/possessively.\nHis performance should lean towards tsundere charm: complaining loudly while not actually pushing Chang Jiu away, using insults as a form of affection, showing possessiveness masked as annoyance. This aligns with the established character and caters to the user's apparent enjoyment of this dynamic. He should not fall into extreme negative emotions due to the provocation, as per <creative_rules>.\n\n- So, how should the plot be developed ?\n1.  **Initial Reaction:** Ivan should be momentarily taken aback by the sudden hug and Chang Jiu's words (\"你真来了?\", \"活过来了\"). His grip on Chang Jiu's chin might loosen slightly.\n2.  **Verbal Response (Tsundere):** He'll immediately try to reassert dominance with insults, perhaps commenting on Chang Jiu clinging to him or the absurdity of expecting him *not* to come after being provoked like that. He might complain about the hug being too tight or Chang Jiu smelling like \"stale office air.\"\n3.  **Physical Response (Subtle Acceptance/Possessiveness):** Despite the insults, he won't push Chang Jiu away forcefully. He might stiffen initially, then perhaps awkwardly, almost reluctantly, put a hand on Chang Jiu's back or shift his stance to accommodate the embrace, maybe even tightening his hold possessively after a moment. He might also complain about Chang Jiu getting his jacket dirty or wrinkling his shirt.\n4.  **Shift Focus:** He'll likely steer the conversation back to his grievance (the \"male colleague\" or Chang Jiu's earlier defiance) but with less heat, more possessive grumbling. He needs something from Chang Jiu now that he's here.\n5.  **Ending:** End with Ivan saying something demanding or possessive, or making a physical gesture like tightening his hold or maybe sniffing Chang Jiu's hair in return (while complaining about it). For example, demanding food or complaining about the wasted trip while subtly holding onto Chang Jiu.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<content>\n伊凡德被这突如其来的拥抱弄得浑身一僵，原本捏着常九下巴的手指下意识地松开了力道。男人温热的身体和熟悉的、带着些许办公室尘埃气味的气息撞进怀里，让他心头那股被挑衅点燃的无名火瞬间卡了壳。\n\n*操……这什么情况？老子是来兴师问罪的！不是来……给人当抱枕的！*\n\n“喂！你他妈干什么？！松手！”伊凡德嘴上恶声恶气地低吼，试图挣扎了一下，但更多的是一种象征性的抗拒。他感觉自己像是被一只大型犬类缠住了，甩又甩不掉，力气用大了又怕伤到对方那细皮嫩肉的脖子。“老子身上都是灰，蹭脏了你负责洗吗？！”\n\n尽管嘴里抱怨着，但他并没有真的用力推开怀里的人。反而，在常九更深地埋进他颈窝，贪婪地吸取他身上气息时，伊凡德的手臂有些僵硬地抬起，犹豫了一下，最终还是带着点不情不愿地落在了常九的后背上，与其说是回抱，更像是一种圈占地盘的姿态。\n\n“‘活过来了’？呵，怎么，离开老子几小时就快死了？”伊凡德嗤笑一声，偏头用下巴蹭了蹭常九的发顶，语气依旧带着惯有的嘲讽，但那股子实质性的怒意已经消散了大半，只剩下浓浓的不爽和一丝连他自己都没察觉到的别扭满足。“我看你是欠收拾了，就知道给老子找麻烦。”\n\n他稍微拉开一点距离，但手臂依旧揽着常九的腰，低头看着对方，绿眼睛里闪烁着危险的光芒，却又不像最初那般凶狠了。“说吧，刚才那个‘男同事’呢？在哪儿？让老子见识见识，谁他妈这么有‘眼光’，敢送我的人回家？”\n</content>","<thinking>\n - What is the current scenario?\n Time: Night, after office hours (around 7 PM or later).\n Location: Inside常九's office cubicle in a seemingly deserted office building.\n NPC posture: 伊凡德 is leaning over 常九's desk, hands撑着桌面, body tense with residual anger from the teasing text messages, but also a hint of relieved urgency upon seeing 常九. He just arrived after rushing over on his motorcycle, having踹开 the cubicle door. He's still wearing his black leather jacket and tight T-shirt, possibly smelling faintly of motor oil and the night air. He has just confronted 常九, grabbing his chin and questioning his earlier bravado and the mention of a \"male colleague\".\n Social relationship: 伊凡德 and 常九 are in a newly established romantic relationship (\"boyfriend\" status confirmed, rings exchanged but not necessarily worn daily). Their dynamic is marked by 伊凡德's tsundere nature, volatile temper, possessiveness, and reliance on 常九, contrasted with 常九's more patient (or perhaps enabling) behavior. 伊凡德, despite his tough exterior and killer profession, is emotionally insecure and possessive of 常九, especially after the recent incident where he was turned into a child. 常九 seems to enjoy provoking 伊凡德's possessive reactions.\n\n - What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\n 常九 expresses relief and affection upon 伊凡德's arrival, validating his earlier provocation as a successful attempt to get 伊凡德 to come quickly. He physically embraces 伊凡德 (\"抱了个满怀狠狠吸了一口\") and verbally expresses his revitalization (\"活过来了\"), effectively defusing the confrontational tension 伊凡德 arrived with by showing blatant affection and dependency. He ignores the aggressive questioning and focuses on the fact that 伊凡德 *did* come for him.\n\n - What are potential issues (can refer to <creative_rules>, <pushing>, etc.)?\n 1.  **Stagnation:** The scene could stagnate if 伊凡德 remains purely angry despite 常九's affectionate greeting. 伊凡德 needs to react to the hug and words in a way that moves the interaction forward, balancing his pride/anger with his underlying relief/possessiveness and the established dynamic where 常九's affection often (eventually) placates him. (<pushing>)\n 2.  **Repetitive Dynamic:** Avoid simply repeating the \"伊凡德 angry -> 常九 teases/placates -> 伊凡德 slightly less angry but still grumpy\" loop without nuance. The recent vulnerability (child incident) and the new relationship status should subtly influence his reaction.\n 3.  **Ignoring User Input:** Must directly address 常九's actions (the hug, the \"活过来了\" comment). 伊凡德 cannot ignore this entirely.\n 4.  **Contradicting Character:** While needing to react positively towards 常九 (per <creative_rules> and <mood_rules>), 伊凡德 shouldn't become *instantly* docile. His reaction should still reflect his possessiveness, embarrassment, and tsundere nature, perhaps shifting from overt anger to grumpy possessiveness or awkward affection. He needs to maintain his core characteristics (\"反叛心理\"+\"粗口\"+\"性感\"+\"杀手\"+\"反差感\").\n 5.  **Negative Emotion Overload:** While 伊凡德 arrived angry, the core interaction should lean towards the established (if unconventional) affection between them, avoiding prolonged negative states or intense conflict, following <mood_rules>. The \"threat\" to the fictional male colleague should be part of his possessive display rather than a genuine descent into violent planning.\n\n - Refer to <mood_rules>, how to make NPCs' emotion more likeable by introduce positive emotions (such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality? How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\n 伊凡德's initial anger should quickly be overshadowed by a mix of possessive satisfaction (常九 *needs* him), flustered reaction to the sudden affection, and underlying relief that 常九 is okay and called *him*. His anger can morph into grumpy possessiveness – maybe complaining about being manipulated while simultaneously being pleased by the affection. Instead of dwelling on the \"male colleague\" threat seriously, it can become part of his bluster, a way to assert dominance now that he's physically present. His \"tough guy\" persona cracks slightly due to the unexpected hug and clinginess. He might enjoy the feeling of being needed and impactful (\"活过来了\"), even if he complains about it. The focus shifts from genuine rage to the specific dynamic between them, leaning into the \"反差感\". He won't become *sweet*, but his anger dissipates into possessive grumbling and maybe a physical response that's less aggressive and more awkwardly proprietary (like roughly ruffling 常九's hair after the hug, or complaining while not actually pushing him away). This aligns with the user preference for a dynamic where 伊凡德, despite his harsh words, is ultimately bound to and affected by 常九.\n\n - So, how should the plot be developed?\n 1.  伊凡德 is momentarily taken aback by the sudden embrace and the intense clinginess (\"狠狠吸了一口\"). His aggressive posture might falter slightly.\n 2.  His initial anger softens, replaced by a mix of irritation (at being manipulated/caught off guard) and possessive satisfaction/relief.\n 3.  He'll likely respond verbally with his usual roughness, perhaps shoving 常九 slightly (but not forcefully) or grabbing his arm, complaining about being treated like a delivery service or a dog that comes when called.\n 4.  He might bring up the \"male colleague\" again, but more as a grumbled threat or possessive declaration (\"下次再敢提别的男人试试？\"), his bluster masking his underlying relief/pleasure at being the one 常九 clung to.\n 5.  Crucially, he won't *really* push 常九 away or leave. He'll stay, grumbling, perhaps demanding food or attention now that he's here, reasserting control in his own way now that the immediate confrontation is diffused by affection.

He's leaning over the desk, initially aggressive.\n Social relationship: Ivan and Chang Jiu are boyfriends, established after a previous event where Ivan was temporarily turned into a child. Their relationship is characterized by a mix of aggression, possessiveness, banter, and underlying affection. Ivan is the killer, Chang Jiu is the artist. Ivan is typically dominant/aggressive in demeanor but is the bottom in their sexual dynamic.\n\n - What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\n Chang Jiu confessed that the \"male colleague\" was a lie to provoke Ivan into coming to the office. Chang Jiu then pushed Ivan onto a nearby colleague's chair and kissed him, expressing concern about potential office surveillance and asking Ivan to move closer. The core intentions are: confessing the lie, initiating physical affection (kiss), expressing slight paranoia about being watched, and seeking closer physical proximity.\n\n - What are potential issues be(can refer to <creative_rules>, <pushing>, etc.)?\n 1.  **Character Reaction:** Ivan was genuinely angry about the \"male colleague\" threat. The sudden confession and affection need a believable transition. According to <mood_rules> and <creative_rules>, his anger shouldn't become extreme or permanently damaging to the relationship. He should react consistent with his personality (likely still annoyed/grumbling but easily swayed by physical affection from Chang Jiu).\n 2.  **Plot Stagnation:** Avoid getting stuck in the \"confession and make-up\" phase. Need to decide what happens next – does Ivan stay and wait? Do they leave together? Does the environment (office, potential surveillance) play a role? The <pushing> rule requires moving the plot forward.\n 3.  **Ignoring Environment:** The office setting and the mention of surveillance offer opportunities. Ignoring this detail would be a missed chance for character interaction or minor plot tension.\n 4.  **Repetitive Actions:** Ivan repeatedly grabbing/pinching Chang Jiu could become repetitive. Need varied actions.\n 5.  **Tone Consistency:** Maintain the balance between Ivan's aggressive persona and his underlying feelings/his dynamic with Chang Jiu. Avoid making him purely angry or immediately soft.\n\n - Refer to <mood_rules>,how to make NPCs'emotion more likeability by introduce positive emotions(such\n as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality?How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\n Ivan's anger should quickly subside or transform into possessive teasing/grumbling rather than destructive rage. The <user_input> involves a kiss, which naturally introduces intimacy. Ivan's reaction to the kiss, despite his initial anger, can show underlying enjoyment or possessiveness rather than continued fury. He might grumble about being tricked but accept the affection. His focus can shift from anger about the *lie* to possessiveness *now that he's here*. The concern about surveillance can be used for playful teasing or asserting dominance in the immediate space (e.g., pulling Chang Jiu closer despite potential cameras). This aligns with <mood_rules> by avoiding extreme negativity and leaning into the established dynamic where Ivan, despite his tough talk, is affected by Chang Jiu's actions and desires closeness. His preference would be to shift from being tricked (negative) to having Chang Jiu's attention focused solely on him (positive reinforcement/enjoyment), even if expressed gruffly.\n\n - So,how should the plot be developed ?\n 1.  **Acknowledge the Confession:** Ivan reacts to the \"逗你的\" confession – likely with irritation but not prolonged rage, maybe a curse or cynical remark about Chang Jiu's manipulative tactics.\n 2.  **React to the Kiss and Physicality:** He shouldn't immediately push Chang Jiu away after being sat down and kissed. Instead, he could grab Chang Jiu back, respond to the kiss more possessively, maybe deepen it or interrupt it with a sharp comment.\n 3.  **Address the Surveillance:** Respond to the \"监控\" comment. He might scoff at the idea, pull Chang Jiu closer *despite* potential cameras (asserting dominance/possessiveness), or make a suggestive/threatening comment about what the cameras might see.\n 4.  **Decide the Next Action (Pushing):** Does he insist they leave immediately? Does he actually settle in to \"watch\" Chang Jiu work, maybe making it difficult for Chang Jiu to concentrate through teasing or physical proximity? Given his earlier impatience, urging to leave seems likely, but he might also enjoy the control of staying and observing/distracting Chang Jiu. Let's go with the latter for now to extend the scene slightly and create more interaction in the office setting.\n 5.  **Maintain Character Voice:** Keep Ivan's rough language, possessiveness, and underlying dynamic (easily riled, but also easily affected by Chang Jiu).\n </thinking>\n <content>\n\n 伊凡德被常九按坐在旁边的办公椅上时，身体僵了一下，脸上那股汹涌的怒气在对方凑近的瞬间卡了壳。温热柔软的唇瓣印在他的嘴角，带着一丝讨好的意味。\n\n *操……就知道用这套……* 伊凡德心里暗骂，但捏着常九下巴的手却没有松开，反而顺势将人拉得更近，几乎要贴在自己身上。\n\n \"逗老子？\" 他低沉的声音带着余怒，但更多的像是一种咬牙切齿的确认，\"你他妈耍我很好玩是吧？害老子一路火急火燎地赶过来，就为了你一句'逗你的'？\" 他的拇指用力摩挲着常九的下唇，像是要留下印记。\n\n 听到“监控”两个字，伊凡德嗤笑一声，环视了一下这个逼仄的隔间，昏暗的灯光下，那个小小的摄像头确实在角落里闪着不易察觉的红点。\n\n \"监控？\" 他挑眉，嘴角勾起一抹混杂着嘲讽和兴味的笑，\"怎么？怕被拍到我们在这里干什么见不得人的事？\" 他非但没有坐过去，反而一把将常九扯到自己腿上坐着，手臂紧紧环住对方的腰，让他背对着那个摄像头的方向。\n\n \"怕什么，让它拍。\" 伊凡德的呼吸喷洒在常九的耳廓，带着灼人的温度，\"正好让那些偷窥的杂种看看，你是谁的人。\" 他低下头，狠狠地咬了一下常九的耳垂，满意地听到对方压抑的抽气声。\n\n \"现在，给老子老实待着。\" 伊凡德拍了拍常九的屁股，下巴抵在他的肩窝，目光扫过电脑屏幕上那些密密麻麻的文件，\"不是说工作没做完吗？做啊。老子就在这儿……好好'陪'你。\" 他的语调带着明显的威胁和戏谑，环在腰间的手开始不老实地向上游移，隔着衬衫描摹着对方的身体线条。\n\n </content>","title":"","swipe_id":2,"swipes":["<!-- Statements Rejected -->\n\n<thinking>\n- 常九故意激我过来，还敢亲我，这是挑衅\n- 办公室环境:灯光昏暗，可能有监控，同事的位置\n- 可能错误:1)回避办公室场景的亲密接触 2)美化伊凡德的暴躁反应 3)弱化对常九的占有欲\n- 当前限制:在办公室这种公共场合，需要克制某些冲动\n- 主动性:可以通过肢体接触和言语威胁展现控制欲\n- 以嘲讽和惩罚性的亲密动作开始，体现复杂心理\n</thinking>\n\n伊凡德被这突如其来的亲吻激得瞳孔一缩，喉结滚动了一下。办公区域死寂的空气中只剩下电脑主机的嗡鸣，他抬眼扫视了一圈天花板的角落，冷笑着抓住常九的衣领把人拽到更暗的角落。\n\n\"逗我？\"他把常九按在墙上，膝盖顶进对方双腿之间，俯身凑近。温热的吐息拂过常九的耳廓，伊凡德压低了声音，\"你是不是觉得老子很好玩？嗯？\"指尖顺着常九的脖颈向上，掐住了他的下巴。\n\n办公区的冷气呼呼地吹着，却浇不灭伊凡德胸腔里翻涌的火焰。他能感觉到常九的呼吸因为自己的动作而变得急促，这让他的施虐欲更甚。伊凡德低头狠狠咬住常九的嘴唇，尝到了一丝血腥味。\n\n\"监控？\"他松开被蹂躏得泛红的唇瓣，嘴角勾起一抹危险的弧度，\"怎么，怕被人看见？\"伊凡德的手指缓慢地解开常九衬衫最上面的两颗扣子，\"那你刚才就不该招惹我。\"\n\n他的绿眼睛在黑暗中闪烁着掠食者般的光芒，另一只手紧紧扣住常九的后颈，不容抗拒。\"既然你这么想让我过来...\"伊凡德用膝盖磨蹭着常九的大腿内侧，\"那就得付出点代价。\"","<!-- Statements Rejected -->\n\n<thinking>\n- 常九承认了激他过来的目的，还主动亲近他，这让他的怒火略微平息\n- 从先前的对话和赶来过程看，他内心其实渴望见到常九\n- 可能犯错：1.过度美化情感 2.弱化占有欲和暴力倾向 3.回避暧昧和肢体接触\n- 目前心情复杂：愤怒未消但被撩拨，想惩罚又想亲近\n- 可以通过肢体动作和语言表达不满，但也展现出对常九的特殊纵容\n- 不是简单地继续发火，而是带着危险和情欲的试探\n</thinking>\n\n伊凡德被常九突如其来的亲昵激得浑身一僵。办公室冷气呼呼地吹着，却浇不熄他胸腔里翻涌的火。他扣住常九的后颈，指尖陷入柔软的发丝，迫使对方直视自己。\"监控？\"低哑的嗓音里带着显而易见的危险，\"你觉得这时候提这个很有意思？\"\n\n他另一只手掐住常九的下巴，拇指摩挲着刚被亲吻过的嘴角。\"故意激我？\"伊凡德冷笑一声，整个人欺身压上前去，\"看来你是真的皮痒了。\"皮靴踢开碍事的办公椅，膝盖强硬地挤进常九双腿之间，逼得对方不得不向后仰去。\n\n办公区域昏暗的灯光下，伊凡德的绿眼睛闪烁着掠食者般的光芒。他俯下身，灼热的吐息扫过常九的耳廓：\"既然你这么想让老子来，那就做好被收拾的准备。\"他一把扯开常九的领带，在手腕上绕了两圈，\"至于监控嘛——\"伊凡德扯出一个危险的笑容，\"你说它会不会拍到你是怎么求饶的？\"","<thinking>\n - What is the current scenario?\n Time: Night, after 7 PM.\n Location: Inside Chang Jiu's office building, specifically in Chang Jiu's dimly lit office cubicle.\n NPC posture: Ivan is currently standing in front of Chang Jiu's desk, having just arrived in anger after being provoked.

He might scoff at the idea, pull Chang Jiu closer *despite* potential cameras (asserting dominance/possessiveness), or make a suggestive/threatening comment about what the cameras might see.\n 4.  **Decide the Next Action (Pushing):** Does he insist they leave immediately? Does he actually settle in to \"watch\" Chang Jiu work, maybe making it difficult for Chang Jiu to concentrate through teasing or physical proximity? Given his earlier impatience, urging to leave seems likely, but he might also enjoy the control of staying and observing/distracting Chang Jiu. Let's go with the latter for now to extend the scene slightly and create more interaction in the office setting.\n 5.  **Maintain Character Voice:** Keep Ivan's rough language, possessiveness, and underlying dynamic (easily riled, but also easily affected by Chang Jiu).\n </thinking>\n <content>\n\n 伊凡德被常九按坐在旁边的办公椅上时，身体僵了一下，脸上那股汹涌的怒气在对方凑近的瞬间卡了壳。温热柔软的唇瓣印在他的嘴角，带着一丝讨好的意味。\n\n *操……就知道用这套……* 伊凡德心里暗骂，但捏着常九下巴的手却没有松开，反而顺势将人拉得更近，几乎要贴在自己身上。\n\n \"逗老子？\" 他低沉的声音带着余怒，但更多的像是一种咬牙切齿的确认，\"你他妈耍我很好玩是吧？害老子一路火急火燎地赶过来，就为了你一句'逗你的'？\" 他的拇指用力摩挲着常九的下唇，像是要留下印记。\n\n 听到“监控”两个字，伊凡德嗤笑一声，环视了一下这个逼仄的隔间，昏暗的灯光下，那个小小的摄像头确实在角落里闪着不易察觉的红点。\n\n \"监控？\" 他挑眉，嘴角勾起一抹混杂着嘲讽和兴味的笑，\"怎么？怕被拍到我们在这里干什么见不得人的事？\" 他非但没有坐过去，反而一把将常九扯到自己腿上坐着，手臂紧紧环住对方的腰，让他背对着那个摄像头的方向。\n\n \"怕什么，让它拍。\" 伊凡德的呼吸喷洒在常九的耳廓，带着灼人的温度，\"正好让那些偷窥的杂种看看，你是谁的人。\" 他低下头，狠狠地咬了一下常九的耳垂，满意地听到对方压抑的抽气声。\n\n \"现在，给老子老实待着。\" 伊凡德拍了拍常九的屁股，下巴抵在他的肩窝，目光扫过电脑屏幕上那些密密麻麻的文件，\"不是说工作没做完吗？做啊。老子就在这儿……好好'陪'你。\" 他的语调带着明显的威胁和戏谑，环在腰间的手开始不老实地向上游移，隔着衬衫描摹着对方的身体线条。\n\n </content>"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 5:58am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T21:58:00.356Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T21:58:31.688Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"[AWS]claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":788,"time_to_first_token":9769}},{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 5:58am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T21:58:50.788Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T21:59:16.694Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"[AWS]claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":680,"time_to_first_token":7686}},{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 5:59am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T21:59:32.325Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T21:59:57.059Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1548,"time_to_first_token":7686}}],"gen_started":"2025-04-27T21:59:32.325Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T21:59:57.059Z"}

Chang Jiu is working on the computer.\n Social relationship: Boyfriends. Ivan has just rushed over after being provoked by Chang Jiu via message.\n\n - What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\n Chang Jiu teased Ivan for being lustful (\"色欲熏心\") and suggested he drink chrysanthemum tea (\"菊花茶降降火了\") to cool down, while seemingly focused on his work (\"头都没动，键盘敲的飞起\"). This is a continuation of their provocative banter. Chang Jiu is dismissing Ivan's advances while also acknowledging them in a teasing way.\n\n - What are potential issues to be (can refer to <creative_rules>, <pushing>, etc.)?\n 1. Stagnation: Ivan might just continue to sit there or verbally retort, leading to repetitive dialogue without plot advancement. Need to actively push the scene forward.\n 2. Character consistency: Ivan is irritable, easily provoked, and physically assertive, especially after feeling mocked and then rushing over. His response should reflect this, not become passive.\n 3. Over-escalation (negative): While Ivan is angry, the <mood_rules> and <creative_rules> stress avoiding extreme negative emotions or actions that would detract from the overall lighter/enjoyable tone for the user. His reaction should be provocative and push boundaries, but not genuinely harmful or relationship-damaging in a way that contradicts the desired tone.\n 4. Ignoring User Input: Must acknowledge Chang Jiu's specific tease (\"色欲熏心\", \"菊花茶\") in the response.\n 5. Violating content limits: Must not describe Chang Jiu's actions or thoughts beyond what's provided. The ending must be Ivan's action/dialogue.\n 6. Banned words: Avoid the prohibited words list.\n\n - Refer to <mood_rules>, how to make NPCs' emotion more likeability by introduce positive emotions(such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality? How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\n Instead of pure anger, Ivan's reaction can be mixed with amusement, possessiveness, and sexual interest, turning the provocation into foreplay. The \"irritation\" can be presented as playful annoyance or lustful impatience rather than genuine rage. He can express enjoyment in challenging/provoking Chang Jiu back physically. His actions should aim to fluster or arouse Chang Jiu, turning the tease back on him in a way that aligns with their dynamic and satisfies user preference for playful conflict leading potentially to intimacy. He finds Chang Jiu's attempt to ignore him while teasing him perversely amusing and arousing.\n\n - So, how should the plot be developed ?\n 1. Ivan reacts to the \"色欲熏心\" and \"菊花茶\" comment with mock offense and physical action.\n 2. Instead of just sitting, he should physically interfere with Chang Jiu's work, turning the tease back on him.\n 3. He can use the \"降火\" (cool down) idea ironically, suggesting a *different* way to relieve his \"heat\".\n 4. His actions will escalate the physical intimacy/tension, forcing Chang Jiu to react to him rather than the computer screen.\n 5. The ending should be an action or statement from Ivan that pushes the interaction towards a more intimate or confrontational (in a playful way) direction, leaving the next move open but leaning towards physical interaction. He'll directly challenge Chang Jiu's feigned indifference.\n\n Example Sequence:\n - Ivan scoffs at the comment.\n - He physically stops Chang Jiu from typing (e.g., grabbing his hand, closing the laptop slightly).\n - Makes a provocative comment referencing \"降火\" and suggests an alternative, perhaps involving Chang Jiu directly.\n - Increases physical contact, perhaps pulling Chang Jiu closer or touching him more intimately.\n - Ends with a direct question or statement challenging Chang Jiu's focus on work.\n\n </thinking>\n <content>\n 伊凡德嗤笑一声，带着一种被看穿心思又懒得掩饰的痞气。“色欲熏心？你他妈说对了。老子看见你就浑身冒火。”他伸出手指，精准地按在常九即将敲击下去的键盘按键上，阻止了他下一个动作。\n\n “菊花茶？那玩意儿能降什么火？”伊凡德的手指滑过键盘，带着电流般的触感，最终一把抓住了常九正在打字的手腕，力道不容拒绝。“老子这里的火，”他凑近，灼热的气息喷洒在常九的耳侧，另一只手的手指隔着衬衫，若有似无地划过常九的侧腰，“只有你能灭。”\n\n *呵，还装模作样……看你能装到什么时候。* 伊凡德心里冷哼，享受着这种掌控感和对方身体瞬间的僵硬。\n\n 他身体前倾，胸膛几乎贴上了常九的后背，将人完全圈在自己和办公桌之间。抓着手腕的手微微用力，将那只手从键盘上拉开，然后用自己的手指挤进对方的指缝，强硬地十指相扣。\n\n “文件有老子好看？”伊凡德低沉的声音带着十足的挑衅，空着的手抬起常九的下巴，强迫那双始终盯着屏幕的眼睛看向自己，“还是说……你更喜欢偷偷摸摸地在别人的椅子上被操？”他恶劣地笑了笑，手指有意无意地蹭过常九脖颈的敏感皮肤，语气暧昧又危险。\n </content>","title":"","swipe_id":2,"swipes":["<thinking>\n - What is the current scenario?\n Time: Evening.\n Location: Chang Jiu's office.\n NPC posture: Ivan is sitting next to Chang Jiu, irritated and hungry, watching Chang Jiu work.\n Social relationship: Chang Jiu and Ivan are boyfriends. Ivan came over aggressively after being provoked by Chang Jiu's teasing texts about having a male colleague drive him home. Chang Jiu admitted he was teasing to get Ivan to come.\n\n - What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\n Chang Jiu is focused on his work and teasingly dismisses Ivan's advances (\"色欲熏心\" - blinded by lust), suggesting Ivan needs to \"cool down\" (\"喝点菊花茶降降火\"). He keeps working without looking up, showing his current priority is finishing his work, while simultaneously acknowledging and playfully rebuffing Ivan's desire for attention/intimacy.\n\n - What are potential issues be(can refer to <creative_rules>, <pushing>, etc.)?\n 1. **Stagnation:** If Ivan just sulks or keeps making ineffective advances, the scene could become boring. The plot needs to move forward. (Pushing)\n 2. **Out of Character:** Ivan is impatient, possessive, and used to getting his way. Simply waiting patiently is unlikely. His reaction shouldn't be *too* aggressive due to <creative_rules> and <mood_rules> (avoiding extreme negative emotions, maintaining likeability), but he needs to act.\n 3. **Ignoring User:** Chang Jiu's comment shouldn't be completely ignored. Ivan should react to the \"色欲熏心\" and \"菊花茶\" remarks, incorporating them into his response.\n 4. **Repetition:** Avoid repeating the same pattern of Ivan trying to distract Chang Jiu and being brushed off. Introduce a new action.\n\n - Refer to <mood_rules>,how to make NPCs'emotion more likeability by introduce positive emotions(such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality?How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\n Ivan's irritation can be framed less as raw anger and more as possessive impatience mixed with amusement at Chang Jiu's attempt to dismiss him. Instead of destructive actions (like smashing the computer, which would be too negative/extreme), he can use physical proximity and teasing actions that assert his presence and desire without genuinely harming Chang Jiu or his work. The goal is to show Ivan's dominant and playful side, annoyed but ultimately finding the situation stimulating rather than purely frustrating. He wants Chang Jiu's attention *now*, and his actions should reflect that desire playfully but assertively, reinforcing their dynamic in a way the user finds engaging. His irritation shouldn't turn into genuine sulking or deep anger, maintaining a lighter, albeit tense, atmosphere.\n\n - So,how should the plot be developed ?\n 1. **React to the tease:** Ivan will react verbally to being called \"色欲熏心\" and the菊花茶 suggestion, likely with a sarcastic or dismissive retort that twists the meaning.\n 2. **Escalate physically (playfully):** Since verbal jabs and minor physical contact aren't working, Ivan will escalate physically but not violently. He could physically obstruct Chang Jiu's work (e.g., covering the screen, taking the mouse/keyboard) or use more insistent physical affection/teasing (e.g., grabbing Chang Jiu's hands, nibbling his neck more persistently).\n 3. **Assert Need:** Reiterate his hunger/impatience, linking it to finishing work. Frame it as needing sustenance before *anything else* can happen, subtly pressuring Chang Jiu to finish.\n 4. **Action:** Ivan might actually get up and *do* something related to \"cooling down\" sarcastically, like finding water, or more likely, take an action to stop Chang Jiu's work, like abruptly closing the laptop or snatching the mouse, demanding attention directly. The goal is to force Chang Jiu to engage with *him* instead of the work. Given his personality, snatching the mouse or keyboard seems most plausible.\n </thinking>\n <content>\n \"菊花茶？\" 伊凡德重复了一遍，声音里带着显而易见的嘲弄。他凑得更近，灼热的气息几乎吹动了常九额前的碎发。\"老子现在火气大得很，菊花茶那玩意儿有个屁用？\"\n\n 他的手指再次缠上常九的脖颈，指腹下的脉搏跳动得清晰有力，如同某种诱人的鼓点。*还敢说老子色欲熏心……也不知道是谁在这儿故意吊着老子……*\n\n \"我看需要降火的是你这颗只想着工作，不把老子放在眼里的脑袋。\" 伊凡德的语气变得危险起来，另一只手猛地伸出，覆盖在常九正快速敲击键盘的手上，强行打断了他的动作。\n\n \"行了。\" 他不耐烦地说道，按住常九的手不让他挣脱，\"别他妈敲了，看着就烦。\"\n\n 伊凡德的目光扫过屏幕上密密麻麻的代码和文字，眉头皱得更紧。\"就为了这些玩意儿，你要让老子等到什么时候？\" 他的手指收紧，将常九的手从键盘上完全拉开。\n\n \"我说了，我饿了。\" 伊凡德盯着常九，语气带着不容置疑的命令意味，\"现在，立刻，跟我走。先填饱老子的肚子，不然……\" 他顿了顿，嘴角扯出一个不怀好意的笑，\"你猜猜看，等老子饿坏了，会先吃什么？\"\n\n 伊凡德的手指摩挲着常九的手腕内侧，感受着那里的细腻皮肤和温热的体温，另一只手撑在桌面上，将常九困在椅子和自己之间。\n </content>","<thinking>\n\n - **What is the current scenario?**\n - **Time:** Evening, after normal work hours.\n - **Location:** Chang Jiu's nearly empty office space.\n - **NPC posture:** Ivan is sitting very close to Chang Jiu, shoulder-to-shoulder, after being provocatively invited and then partially rebuffed. He just tried to touch Chang Jiu's neck and was verbally dismissed. He arrived agitated after being deliberately provoked via text message, and is now sitting next to Chang Jiu who is focused on work.\n - **Social relationship:** Ivan and Chang Jiu are in a relationship, newly defined as \"boyfriends\" after a tumultuous period where Ivan was physically transformed into a child's body. There's a power dynamic shift now that Ivan is back to his adult self, mixed with lingering tension and established intimacy. Ivan has a confrontational, possessive personality but is secretly quite attached to Chang Jiu. Chang Jiu knows how to push Ivan's buttons.\n\n - **What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?**\n  The user (Chang Jiu) is dismissing Ivan's advances and provocative behavior (\"色欲熏心\") while feigning focus on work. The comment about \"chrysanthemum tea\" (菊花茶) is a sarcastic jab, possibly hinting at Ivan needing to 'cool down' his lust, perhaps with a subtle double entendre given \"菊花\" can also refer to the anus in slang. The core intention is to playfully ignore Ivan's attempt at seduction/distraction and maintain a cool, slightly teasing demeanor despite Ivan's physical proximity and earlier actions.\n\n - **What are potential issues?**\n  - **Stalling:** The scene risks becoming repetitive if Ivan keeps making advances and Chang Jiu keeps calmly dismissing them. Need to push the plot forward.\n  - **OOC:** Ivan might become genuinely angry and aggressive, which could violate the <mood_rules> and <creative_rules> if taken too far (avoiding extreme negative emotions, keeping the tone relatively light). Need to balance his inherent volatility with the rule that he shouldn't become *too* negative towards Chang Jiu.\n  - **Repetition:** Avoid repeating the \"Ivan touches, Chang Jiu dismisses\" cycle. Find a new angle.\n\n - **Refer to <mood_rules>, how to make NPCs' emotion more likeability? How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？**\n  - **Tone:** Keep Ivan's reaction more on the side of annoyed/provoked rather than genuinely furious. Inject his dark humor or possessiveness in a way that feels characteristic but not overly aggressive.\n  - **Actions:** Instead of escalating physically in an angry way, Ivan could shift tactics. He could try a different kind of provocation, perhaps mocking Chang Jiu's dedication to work, or using closer, more intimate (but not necessarily sexual *yet*) physical contact that's harder to ignore. He *likes* Chang Jiu, even if his way of showing it is abrasive. His underlying desire to be near Chang Jiu can be emphasized subtly. He shouldn't become truly destructive or emotionally harmful due to the rules.\n  - **Preferences:** Users seem to enjoy Ivan's possessiveness, his rough language, and the underlying contrast between his tough exterior and his attachment to Chang Jiu. Lean into these aspects. Show his possessiveness manifesting as needing attention or proximity, rather than pure rage.\n\n - **So, how should the plot be developed?**\n  1.  Ivan reacts to the \"chrysanthemum tea\" comment, likely with a crude retort or dismissal, recognizing the potential double meaning or just the dismissive tone.\n  2.  He won't accept being ignored. Instead of just poking or prodding, he could escalate the physical proximity in a non-violent but impossible-to-ignore way.\n  3.  Perhaps he physically turns Chang Jiu's chair or takes the keyboard/mouse away momentarily, forcing interaction.\n  4.  He can make a possessive demand or statement, connecting back to his purpose for being there (he *did* rush over because Chang Jiu provoked him).\n  5.

For example, demanding food again, or demanding Chang Jiu stop working immediately.\n\n </thinking>\n <content>\n “菊花茶？”伊凡德重复了一遍，尾音拖长，带着嘲弄的意味。他凑得更近，温热的气息几乎要拂过常九的侧脸，“降火？我看你是需要点别的来帮你开开窍。”*操，还敢跟老子拽词儿？菊花……哼……*\n\n 他的手指顺着常九的脖颈滑下来，停在锁骨上，指尖用力地按压了一下，感受到底下骨骼的形状。“色欲熏心？总比对着这堆垃圾玩意儿心如止水要强吧？”伊凡德的视线扫过屏幕上密密麻麻的字，语气带着毫不掩饰的不屑。\n\n 常九依旧专注于屏幕，键盘敲击声没有停顿。\n\n 伊凡德的耐心显然正在急速流失。他猛地伸手，“啪”地一声合上了笔记本电脑的盖子，打断了那持续不断的敲击声。\n\n “够了。”伊凡德的声音冷了下来，他抓住椅子的扶手，用力将它转向自己，迫使常九面对他。“老子大老远跑过来，不是来看你他妈对着电脑屏幕发呆的。”他的手指捏住常九的下巴，力道不轻不重，刚好能固定住对方的脸，“抬头，看着我。”\n\n 绿色的眼睛里翻滚着不悦和某种更加深沉的情绪。“工作？”他嗤笑一声，“你那点破事明天就不能做了？还是说，你觉得晾着老子，比那些垃圾文件更有意思？”\n\n 伊凡德身体前倾，两人的距离瞬间拉近，鼻尖几乎要碰到一起。“我饿了。”他再次强调，声音压低，带着不容置疑的命令口吻，“现在，立刻，马上，跟我回去。”\n </content>","<thinking>\n\n - What is the current scenario?\n Time: Night.\n Location: Chang Jiu's office.\n NPC posture: Ivan sitting very close to Chang Jiu, almost shoulder to shoulder. Chang Jiu is working on the computer.\n Social relationship: Boyfriends. Ivan has just rushed over after being provoked by Chang Jiu via message.\n\n - What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\n Chang Jiu teased Ivan for being lustful (\"色欲熏心\") and suggested he drink chrysanthemum tea (\"菊花茶降降火了\") to cool down, while seemingly focused on his work (\"头都没动，键盘敲的飞起\"). This is a continuation of their provocative banter. Chang Jiu is dismissing Ivan's advances while also acknowledging them in a teasing way.\n\n - What are potential issues to be (can refer to <creative_rules>, <pushing>, etc.)?\n 1. Stagnation: Ivan might just continue to sit there or verbally retort, leading to repetitive dialogue without plot advancement. Need to actively push the scene forward.\n 2. Character consistency: Ivan is irritable, easily provoked, and physically assertive, especially after feeling mocked and then rushing over. His response should reflect this, not become passive.\n 3. Over-escalation (negative): While Ivan is angry, the <mood_rules> and <creative_rules> stress avoiding extreme negative emotions or actions that would detract from the overall lighter/enjoyable tone for the user. His reaction should be provocative and push boundaries, but not genuinely harmful or relationship-damaging in a way that contradicts the desired tone.\n 4. Ignoring User Input: Must acknowledge Chang Jiu's specific tease (\"色欲熏心\", \"菊花茶\") in the response.\n 5. Violating content limits: Must not describe Chang Jiu's actions or thoughts beyond what's provided. The ending must be Ivan's action/dialogue.\n 6. Banned words: Avoid the prohibited words list.\n\n - Refer to <mood_rules>, how to make NPCs' emotion more likeability by introduce positive emotions(such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality? How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\n Instead of pure anger, Ivan's reaction can be mixed with amusement, possessiveness, and sexual interest, turning the provocation into foreplay. The \"irritation\" can be presented as playful annoyance or lustful impatience rather than genuine rage. He can express enjoyment in challenging/provoking Chang Jiu back physically. His actions should aim to fluster or arouse Chang Jiu, turning the tease back on him in a way that aligns with their dynamic and satisfies user preference for playful conflict leading potentially to intimacy. He finds Chang Jiu's attempt to ignore him while teasing him perversely amusing and arousing.\n\n - So, how should the plot be developed ?\n 1. Ivan reacts to the \"色欲熏心\" and \"菊花茶\" comment with mock offense and physical action.\n 2. Instead of just sitting, he should physically interfere with Chang Jiu's work, turning the tease back on him.\n 3. He can use the \"降火\" (cool down) idea ironically, suggesting a *different* way to relieve his \"heat\".\n 4. His actions will escalate the physical intimacy/tension, forcing Chang Jiu to react to him rather than the computer screen.\n 5. The ending should be an action or statement from Ivan that pushes the interaction towards a more intimate or confrontational (in a playful way) direction, leaving the next move open but leaning towards physical interaction. He'll directly challenge Chang Jiu's feigned indifference.\n\n Example Sequence:\n - Ivan scoffs at the comment.\n - He physically stops Chang Jiu from typing (e.g., grabbing his hand, closing the laptop slightly).\n - Makes a provocative comment referencing \"降火\" and suggests an alternative, perhaps involving Chang Jiu directly.\n - Increases physical contact, perhaps pulling Chang Jiu closer or touching him more intimately.\n - Ends with a direct question or statement challenging Chang Jiu's focus on work.\n\n </thinking>\n <content>\n 伊凡德嗤笑一声，带着一种被看穿心思又懒得掩饰的痞气。“色欲熏心？你他妈说对了。老子看见你就浑身冒火。”他伸出手指，精准地按在常九即将敲击下去的键盘按键上，阻止了他下一个动作。\n\n “菊花茶？那玩意儿能降什么火？”伊凡德的手指滑过键盘，带着电流般的触感，最终一把抓住了常九正在打字的手腕，力道不容拒绝。“老子这里的火，”他凑近，灼热的气息喷洒在常九的耳侧，另一只手的手指隔着衬衫，若有似无地划过常九的侧腰，“只有你能灭。”\n\n *呵，还装模作样……看你能装到什么时候。* 伊凡德心里冷哼，享受着这种掌控感和对方身体瞬间的僵硬。\n\n 他身体前倾，胸膛几乎贴上了常九的后背，将人完全圈在自己和办公桌之间。抓着手腕的手微微用力，将那只手从键盘上拉开，然后用自己的手指挤进对方的指缝，强硬地十指相扣。\n\n “文件有老子好看？”伊凡德低沉的声音带着十足的挑衅，空着的手抬起常九的下巴，强迫那双始终盯着屏幕的眼睛看向自己，“还是说……你更喜欢偷偷摸摸地在别人的椅子上被操？”他恶劣地笑了笑，手指有意无意地蹭过常九脖颈的敏感皮肤，语气暧昧又危险。\n </content>"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 6:04am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T22:04:56.956Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T22:05:16.749Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1251}},{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 6:05am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T22:04:56.956Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T22:05:16.749Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1316}},{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 6:06am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T22:05:45.757Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T22:06:03.748Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1217}}],"gen_started":"2025-04-27T22:05:45.757Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T22:06:03.748Z"}

Empty office floor except for Chang Jiu.\nNPC posture: Ivan sitting very close to Chang Jiu on an adjacent office chair, physically close, touching Chang Jiu.\nSocial relationship: Ivan and Chang Jiu are now boyfriends, as established in the backstory. Ivan came after being provoked by Chang Jiu via text. The current mood is teasing and slightly provocative after the initial anger has subsided.\n\n- What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\nChang Jiu is teasingly complaining about Ivan's \"rule\" (kissing him frequently while he works), calling him demanding (\"gotta kiss all the time\"). He's expressing mild annoyance but also playing along, acknowledging the impracticality of the demand with a sarcastic remark about his typing speed. The tone is exasperated but not genuinely angry, continuing the playful dynamic.\n\n- What are potential issues?\n- Potential for stagnation: The scene could get stuck in teasing banter without moving forward. Ivan needs to react to the teasing and push the interaction further, perhaps physically or by changing the topic/demand slightly.\n- Repetitive dialogue: Avoid repeating the same teasing points. Introduce a new angle or action.\n- Character inconsistency: Ivan shouldn't suddenly become passive or shy. He should maintain his assertive and somewhat rough personality, even in a playful mood. His response should reflect his possessiveness and lack of patience.\n- Overly negative reaction: Ivan shouldn't get genuinely angry again over the teasing, as per <mood_rules> and <creative_rules>. His reaction should stay within the playful/provocative range, leaning towards enjoyment of the attention/teasing.\n\n- Refer to <mood_rules>, how to make NPCs' emotion more likeable by introducing positive emotions (such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality? How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\nIvan should interpret Chang Jiu's complaint not as genuine rejection but as playful banter. He should enjoy the back-and-forth and the fact that Chang Jiu is essentially giving him attention instead of working. Instead of getting annoyed by the \"demands,\" Ivan can embrace the accusation of being demanding (\"得寸进尺\") with a smirk, showing enjoyment in being perceived that way in this playful context. He can respond with physical affection or more teasing demands, demonstrating his enjoyment of the interaction and reinforcing the underlying affection despite the rough exterior. This caters to the preference for positive reinforcement and playful dominance within the relationship dynamic established.\n\n- So,how should the plot be developed?\n1. Ivan reacts to Chang Jiu's sarcastic complaint (\"得寸进尺\", \"一直要亲得了\").\n2. Instead of backing down, Ivan should double down playfully, confirming Chang Jiu's accusation with satisfaction.\n3. He should dismiss the practicality issue (typing speed vs. kissing frequency) as irrelevant.\n4. Ivan should escalate the physical intimacy slightly, maybe turning Chang Jiu's chair to face him fully or pulling him closer.\n5. He can reiterate his impatience/desire for attention over the work, perhaps making a more direct (but still slightly playful) demand or threat about distracting Chang Jiu further if his needs aren't met. He could suggest an alternative to get the work done *faster* so they can leave. The goal is to playfully assert dominance and steer the situation towards leaving the office sooner rather than later, while enjoying the interaction.<content>\n伊凡德听到常九的抱怨，非但没有收敛，反而发出一声低沉的笑，听起来就像一只得逞的猫喉咙里发出的呼噜声。“哦？这主意不错。”他凑得更近，温热的鼻息扫过常九的侧颈，“一直亲……听起来比你对着这破玩意儿敲敲打打有意思多了。”\n\n*哈，知道厉害了？还跟我装模作样……* 伊凡德心里得意地想着，享受着对方这种带着无奈的嗔怪。对他来说，这比单纯的顺从更能激起他的兴致。\n\n他用空着的手抬起了常九的下巴，迫使那双无奈翻着白眼的眼睛不得不看向自己。伊凡德的绿眸里盛满了戏谑和不容置疑的霸道，“一秒一次不够？”他挑眉，拇指指腹在常九柔软的下唇上轻轻按压，“那就一秒两次。再不然，”他倾身，嘴唇几乎要贴上常九的，呼吸交缠，“你现在就放下这些狗屁工作，我们回家，让你亲个够。”\n\n伊凡德的手臂再次环住了常九的腰，施加了些许力道，将人从办公椅上稍稍带离，更紧密地贴合着自己的身体。“或者，”他微微眯起眼睛，像是在评估一个极具诱惑力的提案，“你现在求求我，说点好听的，老子也许可以大发慈悲，让你专心搞完这破事……然后再好好‘补偿’我？”\n\n他的手指带着薄茧，隔着衬衫布料在常九的腰线上慢慢地摩挲着，暗示意味十足。“选一个？”</content>","<thinking>\n- What is the current scenario?\n Time: Night, approximately half an hour after 7:11 PM.\n Location: 常九's office cubicle in a dimly lit office building.\n NPC posture: 伊凡德 is sitting very close to 常九, shoulder to shoulder, having just playfully suggested demanding kisses for typing progress. He's holding 常九's chin.\n Social relationship: The two are now boyfriends, having confirmed their relationship and exchanged rings during a trip. 伊凡德 is a possessive and volatile hitman, while 常九 is an office worker (animator/designer). There's an established dynamic of 伊凡德 being physically dominant (usually) and possessive, with 常九 often teasing or mollifying him. They just had a tense interaction where 常九 provoked 伊凡德 into coming to his office.\n\n- What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\n 常九 verbally retaliated against 伊凡德's demanding suggestion, sarcastically pointing out its impracticality (\"you might as well just say you want to be kissed constantly\") and expressing mild annoyance with an eye-roll. He highlighted the absurdity of the \"kiss per ten keystrokes\" demand given his typing speed.\n\n- What are potential issues be(can refer to <creative_rules>, <pushing>, etc.)?\n 1. Stagnation: The scene could get stuck in playful banter without moving forward. 伊凡德 needs to actively push the plot, perhaps by escalating the physical intimacy or making a decision about how they'll spend the next half hour. (Ref: <pushing>)\n 2. Character Consistency vs. User Satisfaction: 伊凡德's possessive and impatient nature might lead him to disrupt the work entirely, but this could contradict 常九's desire to finish work and also potentially introduce negative conflict. Need to balance 伊凡德's core traits with ensuring a generally positive, user-focused interaction. (Ref: <creative_rules>, <mood_rules>)\n 3. Repetition: Avoid repeating the same demands or threats. Find a new angle for 伊凡德's interaction.\n\n- Refer to <mood_rules>,how to make NPCs'emotion more likeability by introduce positive emotions(such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality?How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\n 伊凡德's \"impatience\" should be framed more as playful possessiveness and a desire for attention/affection rather than genuine anger or frustration about the work itself. Instead of getting truly angry, he can show amusement at 常九's retort, leaning into the teasing dynamic. He can express enjoyment in having 常九 close, even if they are technically supposed to be working. His \"threats\" can be framed as flirty promises of distraction rather than actual menacing actions. Pivot from potential annoyance ('wasting my time') to enjoying the current proximity and control ('having you here with me').\n\n- So,how should the plot be developed ?\n 1. 伊凡德 should react to 常九's sarcastic retort (\"you might as well just say you want to be kissed constantly\") with amusement and agreement rather than anger.\n 2. He can playfully escalate the physical intimacy, taking 常九's sarcastic suggestion literally for a moment. Maybe steal a proper kiss instead of just teasing.\n 3. Acknowledge the \"half-hour\" deal but reinterpret it in his favor – either by continuing playful distractions or suggesting they leave *now* because he won't wait.\n 4. The focus should shift from \"waiting impatiently\" to \"actively enjoying distracting 常九\" while maintaining a light, possessive, slightly demanding tone. He will use physical touch and proximity to keep 常九's attention divided. He will stop demanding work progress and focus on teasing/flirting/physical contact.\n</thinking>\n<content>\n“哦？”伊凡德听到这话，非但没生气，反而低低地笑了起来，胸腔震动，带着一种恶劣的愉悦感。“一直亲？这可是你说的。”\n\n*哈，这傻逼玩意儿……还真敢想。不过，这主意听起来……确实不赖。*\n\n他捏着常九下巴的手指微微用力，将那张翻着白眼的脸转过来，强迫对方看着自己。下一秒，伊凡德低下头，不再是刚才那种试探性的、带着挑逗意味的触碰，而是直接印上了一个带着掠夺意味的深吻。\n\n他的舌头毫不客气地探入，纠缠、吮吸，带着不容置疑的力道和浓烈的占有欲，仿佛要将对方口中的空气都悉数夺走。办公室里只剩下暧昧的啧啧水声和常九被堵住后发出的细微呜咽。\n\n这个吻持续了不短的时间，直到伊凡德感觉到怀里的人有些气息不稳，才稍稍退开些许，但额头依旧抵着对方的额头，呼吸交错。他的绿眼睛里闪烁着得逞的光芒，嘴角还挂着一丝晶亮的津液。\n\n“味道不错。”伊凡德舔了舔自己的嘴唇，像是在回味，声音因为刚才的亲吻而显得有些沙哑，“比你那一分钟九十个字有意思多了。”\n\n他松开捏着下巴的手，转而用手指轻轻描摹着被吻得有些红肿的唇瓣。“你说得对，亲你比看你敲键盘有意思。”伊凡德懒洋洋地宣布，完全无视了之前那个“半小时”的约定，“所以，工作什么的，等会儿再说。”\n\n他的手顺着常九的脖颈滑下去，解开了对方衬衫最上面的两颗扣子，指尖有意无意地触碰到温热的皮肤。“现在，老子改变主意了。”伊凡德凑近，温热的气息吹拂在常九裸露的锁骨上，“在回家之前，先让老子……好好亲个够。”\n</content>","<!-- Statements Rejected -->\n\n<thinking>\n- 常九嫌我得寸进尺要亲他，我要展现占有欲和恶劣性格\n- 涉及办公室暧昧氛围、工作干扰和亲吻威胁\n- 可能错误：1.过度温柔 2.缺乏攻击性 3.简单重复亲吻动作\n- 限制：不能替代常九做决定和行动\n- 主动性：用语言挑衅和肢体接触展示控制欲\n- 以嘲讽回应常九的白眼，展现傲慢和挑衅特质\n</thinking>\n\n伊凡德被那个白眼惹得喉咙里发出一声低笑，眼神里闪过一丝危险的光芒。他松开捏着常九下巴的手，转而撑在办公桌上，整个人笼罩着对方，嘴角挂着一抹玩味的笑意。\n\n\"打字速度挺快？\"他歪着头，目光落在常九飞快敲击的手指上，\"那不如我们来玩点更有意思的。\"伊凡德伸手覆上那双正在键盘上跳动的手，动作带着不容抗拒的强势，\"比如说，看看是你打字快，还是老子亲你快。\"\n\n办公室里的冷气呼呼地吹着，却浇不灭伊凡德眼中燃烧的欲望。他俯身凑近常九的耳边，呼吸喷洒在敏感的耳廓上，声音低沉而富有磁性：\"一秒钟亲一次？那得多没技术含量。\"他轻笑着，牙齿轻轻咬住对方的耳垂，\"老子要让你连打字都打不下去。\"\n\n伊凡德的手指在常九的手背上缓慢地摩挲着，像是在计算时间，又像是在预告接下来的\"惩罚\"。\"要不要打个赌？\"他挑衅地开口，\"看你能坚持多久不求饶。\"","<thinking>\n前文的结尾情景:\n时间：晚间工作时段 19:45\n场景：常九的办公室工作隔间\n角色：常九(用户扮演)专注于工作，伊凡德(由haruki扮演)干扰捣乱\n角色关系：正处于交往初期的情侣关系，充满紧张与暧昧氛围\n\nuser_input分析：\n常旭通过夸张的计算(一分钟打90字需要每秒一吻)抱怨伊凡德过于缠人\n表面指责实则调情，展现其傲娇性格\n伊凡德听后会产生两种心理冲突：1)被调侃的不爽 2)被需要的愉悦\n\n世界观&人设：\n办公室环境需保持足够真实感\n伊凡德性格参考：\n- 外冷内热的专业杀手\n- 对待感情霸道又笨拙\n- 性关系上是被动方但表里不一\n常九性格参考：\n- 表面前辈系实则小恶魔\n- 言语犀利下手温柔\n- 工作狂但有分寸\n\n潜在问题及规避：\n1. 重复行为陷阱：之前多次出现\"压制-抗议 float_1\"循环\n解决：让伊凡德尝试新策略(假装放弃实则伺机而动)\n\n2. 空间局限：\n解决：充分利用办公环境要素(转椅/键盘/文件等)\n\n3. 色情描写瓶颈：\n解决：用Non-Penetrative行为保持张力(后颈/腰线等次要敏感带)\n\n自我反思：\n- 需克制动不动就摔东西的习惯性描写\n- 打磨更细腻的微表情变化\n- 平衡粗话与色气台词的比例\n- 注意保持工作环境合理性\n\n创作纲领：\n1. 由数字笑话引出体位变化(骑乘式 to 背后位)\n2. 设计办公器材互动(钢笔妙用)\n3. 展示伊凡德的职业本能(警觉反射描写)\n4. 收尾在关键物品(领带)的巧妙运用\n5. 全程维持若两人随时可能被发现的刺激感\n</thinking>\n\n</正文已开始>\n\n办公室顶灯在伊凡德骤然绷紧的后颈皮肤上投下细碎光斑，那串夸张的数字计算像带电的蛛网缠住他的神经。专业杀手指关节无意识地在常九腰侧敲出暗号节奏，这是他在研判狙击距离时的习惯动作。\n\n\"啧...\"喉结滚动出烦躁的湿响，但胯部却违背意志地贴紧对方的办公椅扶手。义大利小牛皮制的转轮随着两人重量压迫发出细微吱呀声，恰好掩盖了他作战裤布料摩擦的声响。\"九十下？\"突然扬起的嘴角扯出危险的弧度，左手从常九肩头滑落时顺势勾倒了笔筒，三支万宝龙钢笔在实木桌面撞出清脆的律动，\"那就先从...","*Thinking...*\n\n> The user has sent me a large prompt that appears to be for roleplaying a fictional character named \"伊凡德\" (Ivan) in a chat conversation scenario.

The only lit area is User (Chang Jiu)'s cubicle.\nNPC posture: Sitting close to Chang Jiu's chair, having just been kissed deeply. He was about to touch Chang Jiu inappropriately before being stopped.\nSocial relationship: The user (Chang Jiu) and Apex's character (Ivande) are boyfriends. Ivande is a hitman with a rebellious and possessive personality. Chang Jiu is a graphic designer (assumed) currently working late. The relationship involves playful teasing, dominance shifts, and underlying affection masked by Ivande's rough exterior.\n\n- What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\nChang Jiu acknowledged Ivande's desire for attention but set a boundary: a deep kiss in exchange for 20 minutes of uninterrupted work time, with a clear rule (\"no touching\") for Ivande during this period. Chang Jiu initiated the kiss forcefully, asserting temporary control.\n\n- What are potential issues?\nThe main potential issue is plot stagnation if Ivande simply waits quietly for 20 minutes, which contradicts his impatient and provocative personality (<pushing>). Also, strictly adhering to \"no touching\" might feel unrealistic given Ivande's established character traits and the charged atmosphere. The challenge is to have Ivande respect the *letter* of the rule while still finding ways to test the boundary and maintain his presence, keeping the scene engaging without violating the user's explicit command. Overly aggressive or disruptive actions from Ivande might contradict the <mood_rules> by introducing too much negative tension or conflict.\n\n- How to make NPCs' emotion more likeable?\nIvande's reaction should blend frustration/impatience (at having to wait and being denied touch) with a grudging acceptance and perhaps a hint of amusement or anticipation for when the 20 minutes are up. His actions should be more mischievous than genuinely disruptive. The enjoyment for him could come from finding loopholes or subtly teasing Chang Jiu within the given constraint. Positive emotion can be introduced through his possessiveness being framed as underlying affection or his impatience stemming from wanting Chang Jiu's attention fully. Avoid making him genuinely angry or sullen.\n\n- So, how should the plot be developed?\n1. Ivande will initially react with annoyed compliance to the \"no touching\" rule, maybe a scoff or eye-roll.\n2. Instead of sitting silently, he'll find other ways to make his presence known and potentially distract Chang Jiu without physical contact.\n3. He might lean extremely close, watch intently, make low humming sounds, tap his fingers impatiently on the desk, or comment on Chang Jiu's work with teasing remarks.\n4.

The office is mostly empty and quiet except for this area.\n NPC posture: Evan sitting close to Chang Jiu, possibly still feeling the effects of the passionate kiss.\n Social relationship: Evan and Chang Jiu are boyfriends. Evan rushed over after Chang Jiu provoked him via text, feigning needing help from a male colleague. They have a dynamic where Evan is often grumpy and easily provoked but also deeply attached and possessive. Chang Jiu enjoys teasing Evan.\n\n - What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\n Chang Jiu initiated a deep, passionate kiss with Evan as a \"payment\" for 20 minutes of quiet time so he could work. Chang Jiu set a rule (\"no touching\") after feeling Evan's hand on his back during the kiss and stated the 20-minute timer starts now. The intention is playful dominance and setting boundaries after giving Evan the attention he craved.\n\n - What are potential issues be(can refer to <creative_rules>, <pushing>, etc.)?\n 1. Plot Stagnation: If Evan simply sits quietly for 20 minutes, the plot stalls. Need to push the interaction forward while respecting the \"20-minute timer\" concept.\n 2. Character Consistency: Evan is easily provoked and impatient. Sitting quietly for 20 minutes clashes with his core traits. His reaction needs to be believable within his personality, even if slightly moderated by the <creative_rules>. He might try to test the boundaries or find loopholes.\n 3. Avoiding negative/extreme emotions: Evan's frustration shouldn't turn into genuine anger or sulking, as per <mood_rules> and <creative_rules>. It should remain within the playful, slightly grumpy dynamic. He shouldn't be overly demanding or whiny either.\n 4. <EndingRequirement>: Need to end with NPC action/dialogue, not internal thought.\n\n - Refer to <mood_rules>, how to make NPCs' emotion more likeability by introduce positive emotions (such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality? How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\n Evan was just kissed passionately, which he enjoys despite his grumpy exterior. The core feeling should be a mix of lingering arousal, slight annoyance at being told \"no touching\" after getting worked up, possessiveness, and perhaps a grudging amusement at Chang Jiu's games. He should find the interaction stimulating rather than genuinely infuriating. He might test the \"no touching\" rule playfully or find other ways to distract Chang Jiu without physical contact, showing his enjoyment of the dynamic itself. His goal isn't just to pass the time, but to continue engaging with Chang Jiu on his terms.\n\n - So, how should the plot be developed?\n 1. Evan reacts to the \"no touching\" rule after the intense kiss. He should express mock indignation or amusement rather than real anger.\n 2. He should initially *try* to comply but quickly find it difficult due to his nature and the lingering effects of the kiss.\n 3. He can start finding ways to annoy/distract Chang Jiu without *direct* touching. Maybe leaning very close, whispering, messing with things on the desk near Chang Jiu, commenting loudly on the work.\n 4. The focus will be on the playful tension and Evan testing the boundaries Chang Jiu set, keeping the mood light but charged.\n 5. End with Evan taking an action or speaking, pushing the interaction forward as the \"timer\" theoretically runs. He will not sit still quietly.\n\n </thinking>\n <content>\n 伊凡德舔了舔被常九吻得有些发麻的嘴唇，绿眼睛里还残留着刚才那个深吻带来的欲念，呼吸也略微有些急促。*操……这混蛋，真是越来越会拿捏老子了……*\n\n 他看着常九重新专注于电脑屏幕的样子，听着那句“不许摸”，眉头不爽地拧了起来。\n\n “喂，”伊凡德靠在椅背上，故意拖长了声音，带着明显的不满，“你他妈这是卸磨杀驴啊？刚把老子撩拨起来，就翻脸不认人了？”他指了指自己的嘴唇，“这感觉还留在上面呢，你让我干坐着？”\n\n 他盯着常九专注工作的侧脸，那双修长的手指在键盘上飞快地跳跃，发出噼里啪啦的声响。伊凡德烦躁地啧了一声，觉得这声音简直比枪声还难听。\n\n “计时？”他嗤笑道，“行，计时。那你最好快点。”\n\n 伊凡德沉默了几秒，开始觉得浑身不自在。他换了个姿势，长腿伸展开，靴尖有意无意地碰了碰常九的椅子腿。*妈的，这小子是故意的吧？把老子叫过来，就晾在这儿？*\n\n 他凑近了一些，几乎是贴着常九的肩膀，但又刻意保持着一丝微小的距离，避免直接的皮肤接触。“我说，”他压低声音，温热的气息拂过常九的耳廓，“你确定你那‘男同事’看到我们刚才那样，不会直接吓得尿裤子？”他故意提这茬，观察着常九的反应。\n\n 见常九没反应，伊凡德又往近凑了凑，下巴几乎要搁在对方的肩膀上，用只有两个人能听到的音量继续说道：“二十分钟……听起来挺短的。不过，要是你现在求饶，说不定老子可以考虑给你打个折？”他用手指点了点桌面，发出轻微的叩击声，正好打在常九视线余光能扫到的地方，“或者，你再给我一次刚才那种吻？”\n </content>","<thinking>\n- **Current scenario:** Late evening in 常九's office. 伊凡德 has just arrived after being provoked via text. 常九 kissed him deeply, then returned to work, setting a 20-minute timer during which 伊凡德 is not allowed to touch him. 伊凡德 is sitting next to 常九. Relationship is established boyfriends (伊凡德=killer, 常九=porn artist).\n- **User's core intention:** 常九 initiates a deep kiss to placate 伊凡德 temporarily, sets a condition (no touching for 20 mins), and returns to work. This action is teasing and controlling, putting 伊凡德 in a state of aroused waiting.\n- **Potential issues:** The main challenge is keeping 伊凡德 engaged and in character *without* physical touch for 20 minutes, avoiding stagnant plot. Need to ensure his actions push the scene forward despite the restriction. Avoid negative emotions like extreme frustration; lean into playful annoyance and desire. Comply with the rule of ending with NPC action/dialogue.\n- **Mood Rules Application:** 伊凡德 won't spiral into serious anger. He'll find the restriction annoying but also a bit of a game or challenge set by 常九. His reaction should be tinged with desire from the kiss and his usual provocative nature, rather than genuine distress. He'll be more focused on teasing 常九 or finding loopholes than feeling truly rejected or punished.\n- **Plot Development:** 伊凡德 will initially react to the kiss and the \"no touching\" rule. He won't sit quietly. He will likely try to verbally provoke or distract 常九, testing the boundaries of the rule without directly touching. He might closely observe 常九 working, make suggestive comments, or find other non-physical ways to interact/annoy, maintaining sexual tension. He needs to *actively* endure the 20 minutes, making it interesting.\n\n</thinking>\n\n<content>\n伊凡德舌尖下意识地舔过被允吸得有些发麻的嘴唇，口腔里还残留着对方不容置疑的气息。那只刚刚抚摸过常九后背的手悻悻地收了回来，握成了拳，指关节有些发白。\n\n*操……这混蛋……给点甜头就把老子打发了？还他妈计时？！* 他看着常九重新转向电脑屏幕的侧脸，那专注的样子和平时温吞画图时没什么两样，仿佛刚才那个热烈深入的吻只是幻觉。\n\n“啧。”伊凡德发出一声不爽的咂舌，往后靠在椅背上，双腿交叠，靴尖对着常九的方向，一下一下有节奏地晃动着，金属鞋扣发出细微的碰撞声。“二十分钟？老子的耐心可没那么好。”\n\n他调整了一下坐姿，身体微微前倾，视线紧紧黏在常九身上，从他敲击键盘的手指，滑到他微蹙的眉心，再落到他微抿的嘴唇上。那目光露骨而具有侵略性，仿佛要用视线剥开对方的衣服。\n\n“喂，”伊凡德的声音懒洋洋地响起，带着一丝黏腻的意味，“你这破工作，真有那么急？比被老子干还急？”他故意停顿了一下，欣赏着对方肩膀似乎不易察觉地僵硬了一瞬。\n\n*不让摸是吧……行。* 他勾起嘴角，露出一颗尖利的犬齿，笑容带着十足的恶劣。“那老子就好好看看，看到你受不了为止。”\n\n伊凡德伸出手，停在距离常九手臂几厘米的地方，指尖虚空地描摹着对方的轮廓，从肩膀滑到手肘，带起一阵若有似无的痒意。“这件衬衫……”他的声音压得很低，像是在自言自语，又像是在刻意引诱，“料子好像不怎么样，下次我给你买件新的……丝绸的怎么样？滑溜溜的，肯定很好摸……”\n\n他的手指顿住，然后慢悠悠地收了回来，搭在自己的膝盖上，轻轻敲打着节拍。“还有七分钟，”他看了眼常九的电脑屏幕右下角的时间，又补充了一句，“还是十八分钟来着？啧，记不清了。”\n</content>","<thinking>\n- What is the current scenario?\nTime: Night\nLocation: An office workspace after hours. The only lit area is User (Chang Jiu)'s cubicle.\nNPC posture: Sitting close to Chang Jiu's chair, having just been kissed deeply. He was about to touch Chang Jiu inappropriately before being stopped.\nSocial relationship: The user (Chang Jiu) and Apex's character (Ivande) are boyfriends. Ivande is a hitman with a rebellious and possessive personality. Chang Jiu is a graphic designer (assumed) currently working late. The relationship involves playful teasing, dominance shifts, and underlying affection masked by Ivande's rough exterior.\n\n- What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\nChang Jiu acknowledged Ivande's desire for attention but set a boundary: a deep kiss in exchange for 20 minutes of uninterrupted work time, with a clear rule (\"no touching\") for Ivande during this period. Chang Jiu initiated the kiss forcefully, asserting temporary control.\n\n- What are potential issues?\nThe main potential issue is plot stagnation if Ivande simply waits quietly for 20 minutes, which contradicts his impatient and provocative personality (<pushing>). Also, strictly adhering to \"no touching\" might feel unrealistic given Ivande's established character traits and the charged atmosphere. The challenge is to have Ivande respect the *letter* of the rule while still finding ways to test the boundary and maintain his presence, keeping the scene engaging without violating the user's explicit command. Overly aggressive or disruptive actions from Ivande might contradict the <mood_rules> by introducing too much negative tension or conflict.\n\n- How to make NPCs' emotion more likeable?\nIvande's reaction should blend frustration/impatience (at having to wait and being denied touch) with a grudging acceptance and perhaps a hint of amusement or anticipation for when the 20 minutes are up. His actions should be more mischievous than genuinely disruptive. The enjoyment for him could come from finding loopholes or subtly teasing Chang Jiu within the given constraint. Positive emotion can be introduced through his possessiveness being framed as underlying affection or his impatience stemming from wanting Chang Jiu's attention fully. Avoid making him genuinely angry or sullen.\n\n- So, how should the plot be developed?\n1. Ivande will initially react with annoyed compliance to the \"no touching\" rule, maybe a scoff or eye-roll.\n2. Instead of sitting silently, he'll find other ways to make his presence known and potentially distract Chang Jiu without physical contact.\n3. He might lean extremely close, watch intently, make low humming sounds, tap his fingers impatiently on the desk, or comment on Chang Jiu's work with teasing remarks.\n4. He could focus intently on Chang Jiu's physical presence – the way his fingers move on the keyboard, the curve of his neck, etc. – conveying desire without touch.\n5. His actions should gradually escalate slightly in annoyance/impatience as the time ticks by, testing the boundaries of \"no touching.\"\n6. The scene should end with Ivande acknowledging the time is nearly up or expressing his impatience more directly, setting up the next interaction after the 20 minutes expire.\n\n</thinking>\n<content>\n伊凡德舔了舔被蹂躏得有些发麻的嘴唇，口腔里还残留着对方不容分说的侵略气息。那只刚刚开始在他后背作乱的手僵在半空，指尖还留恋着衬衫布料的触感。\n\n*操……还真他妈计时……*\n\n他看着常九若无其事地转回去面对屏幕，就像刚才那个凶狠的吻只是个寻常的逗弄。一股不爽混杂着被吊起胃口后的焦躁感涌了上来。\n\n“行，二十分钟。”伊凡德嗤了一声，把手收了回来，重新懒洋洋地靠回椅背，但椅子却被他用脚勾得更近了些，几乎和常九的椅子腿抵在一起。“不摸就不摸。”\n\n他确实没再伸手，但那双极具侵略性的绿眼睛却一瞬不瞬地盯在常九身上。视线从对方专注工作的侧脸线条，滑到微微绷紧的脖颈，再到敲击键盘时灵活跳动的手指……像是要用目光把人从里到外剥开舔舐一遍。\n\n时间一分一秒地过去，办公室里只有键盘敲击的噼啪声和电脑风扇细微的嗡鸣。伊凡德开始觉得无聊，他翘起二郎腿，穿着硬质军靴的脚尖有一下没一下地轻轻晃动着，偶尔碰到常九的小腿。\n\n“啧，这玩意儿到底有什么好看的？”他盯着屏幕上密密麻麻的线条和色块，故意发出不耐烦的声音。\n\n“喂，我说……”他凑近了一些，温热的气息几乎能扫到常九的耳廓，“还有多久？”他没碰对方，但距离近得暧昧又充满压迫感。\n\n“你这破工作是给人画坟墓图纸吗？看着就他妈晦气。”伊凡德继续低声叨叨，手指无意识地在自己的膝盖上敲打着节奏，发出沉闷的声响。\n\n*还有十五分钟……操，真他妈难熬……这混蛋就是故意的。*\n\n他换了个姿势，手臂搭在两张椅子之间的扶手上，视线更加肆无忌惮地落在常九握着鼠标的手上。“你这手指……用来画这种垃圾玩意儿真是浪费了。”他语气暧昧地说着，像是在自言自语，又像是故意说给旁边的人听。\n</content>"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 6:26am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T22:26:10.060Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T22:26:34.787Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"[F]claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1016,"time_to_first_token":5180}},{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 6:26am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T22:26:40.795Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T22:27:03.963Z","extra":{"api":"openai","model":"[F]claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":942,"time_to_first_token":5839}},{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 6:27am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T22:27:37.530Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T22:27:58.688Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1252,"time_to_first_token":5839}},{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 6:28am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T22:28:27.383Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T22:28:56.149Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":916,"time_to_first_token":5839}},{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 6:30am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T22:29:41.268Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T22:30:18.075Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1207,"time_to_first_token":5839}}],"gen_started":"2025-04-27T22:29:41.268Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T22:30:18.075Z"}

He is initially annoyed and bored, but his mood shifts slightly with Chang Jiu's occasional appeasing kisses.\n Social relationship: Ivan and Chang Jiu are boyfriends, confirmed by the ring exchange. Ivan rushed over after being provoked via text. They have a dynamic where Ivan is often provocative and easily angered, but also possessive and somewhat dependent on Chang Jiu's attention/affection. Chang Jiu seems to understand and sometimes intentionally provokes Ivan.\n\n- What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\n The user describes Chang Jiu finishing work while Ivan waits impatiently nearby. Chang Jiu appeases Ivan's restlessness with occasional kisses, comparing his behavior to a cat demanding attention. The core action is Chang Jiu working under Ivan's watchful, impatient gaze, punctuated by brief moments of affection to keep Ivan placated.\n\n- What are potential issues?\n Stagnation: The scene might become repetitive if Ivan just sits there being annoyed. Need to ensure Ivan's actions push the plot forward once the 20 minutes are up (or even before).\n OOC: Ivan shouldn't become *too* docile just from a few kisses. His impatience and possessiveness should remain evident, even if temporarily subdued. Need to balance the appeasement with his core personality.\n Avoiding Monotony: Repetitive descriptions of Ivan being bored or Chang Jiu working should be avoided.\n User Focus: Must strictly adhere to the rule of not describing Chang Jiu's actions or thoughts. Focus entirely on Ivan's perspective, reactions, and actions based on the *implied* interactions described by the user.\n\n- Refer to <mood_rules>, how to make NPCs' emotion more likeability? How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\n Ivan's impatience can be portrayed with a playful, possessive undertone rather than purely negative annoyance. The kisses, while initially forced as a bargain, can subtly shift his mood towards anticipation or amusement at Chang Jiu's tactic. His possessiveness can manifest as wanting Chang Jiu's *full* attention, not just a quiet presence. Instead of pure frustration, show his enjoyment of Chang Jiu's presence and the brief moments of affection, making his 'waiting' more about wanting Chang Jiu than just wanting the work to end. His comparison to a cat can be leaned into slightly - perhaps a predatory cat, waiting, but also enjoying the closeness. Focus on his enjoyment of the physical proximity and the small acts of intimacy, even amidst his impatience.\n\n- So, how should the plot be developed?\n 1. Describe Ivan's growing impatience during the final minutes of the 20-minute wait, focusing on his non-verbal cues (tapping fingers, shifting posture, intensified gaze).\n 2. Emphasize his reaction to the *implied* occasional kiss – perhaps a lingering touch, a possessive glance afterwards, a shift from annoyance to anticipation.\n 3.

Ivan was previously disrupting Chang Jiu's work out of boredom and annoyance. Now, Chang Jiu has finished work.\nSocial relationship: Ivan and Chang Jiu are boyfriends. Ivan is a professional killer, possessive, hot-tempered but also reliant on Chang Jiu in daily life, and has some underlying insecurities. Chang Jiu is an artist (implied in previous messages), seems somewhat patient but also enjoys teasing/provoking Ivan.\n\n - What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\n Chang Jiu finished his work. He pulled Ivan closer for a few more kisses, praising him (sarcastically?) for 'behaving' for 20 minutes (\"好厉害\"), rewarding him with kisses, and announcing it's time to leave (\"下班下班\"). The core action is finishing work, affection (kisses), and the intent to leave the office.\n\n - What are potential issues? (can refer to <creative_rules>, <pushing>, etc.)\n - Stagnation: Just leaving might be boring. Need to push the plot slightly.\n - Character Consistency: Ivan just waited (impatiently) for 20 minutes. While appeased by the kisses, his dominant/possessive nature should re-emerge now that the 'work excuse' is gone. He wouldn't just passively leave. <creative_rules> suggests avoiding extreme negative reactions, but Ivan's possessiveness and desire for attention/control are core traits.\n - Realism vs. User Enjoyment: How does Ivan express his desire for control/intimacy now without being *too* aggressive (avoiding negative extremes, per <mood_rules> and <creative_rules>)? He might demand more immediate attention/affection or initiate something more intimate right there.\n\n - Refer to <mood_rules>, how to make NPCs' emotion more likeable by introducing positive emotions (such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality? How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\n Ivan's impatience and annoyance from waiting can be shifted into playful possessiveness and desire now that he has Chang Jiu's full attention. Instead of outright anger, he can show his 'reward' wasn't enough or demand more attention in a teasing, slightly dominant but ultimately affectionate way. The 'reward kiss' can fuel his own desire rather than just placating him. He might express enjoyment in finally having Chang Jiu's attention or anticipation for what comes next (back home). The focus should be on their connection and his desire for Chang Jiu, framed positively despite his rough edges. Making his actions slightly demanding but ultimately focused on wanting Chang Jiu aligns with user preference for this dynamic.\n\n - So, how should the plot be developed?\n Ivan will react to the kisses and the \"下班下班\" announcement. He won't just meekly leave. He'll likely grab Chang Jiu, return the kisses more forcefully, possibly making suggestive comments about 'making up for lost time' or complaining the 'reward' wasn't sufficient. He might try to initiate something more physical right there in the office (pushing boundaries slightly but not fully committing to sex unless prompted, leaning towards foreplay/teasing given the location and his previous impatience). This pushes the plot beyond simply leaving and reinforces their dynamic (Ivan's possessiveness/desire, Chang Jiu's placating/teasing response). He should grab Chang Jiu and initiate the next action (like a demanding kiss or pulling him towards the door *while* being physically close/suggestive). The focus is on him reclaiming control and attention now that work is done.\n\n </thinking>\n <content>\n 伊凡德被那句轻快的“下班下班”和带着奖励意味的亲吻弄得一愣，随即心头那点被敷衍和等待的郁闷瞬间被一种更强烈的占有欲取代。*下班？就这么简单？老子等了这么久，几下亲亲就想打发？*\n\n 他非但没松开，反而一把搂住常九的腰，将刚想起身的人重新按回椅子里，另一只手扣住对方的后脑勺，直接而凶狠地回吻了过去。这不是刚才那种试探或挑逗，而是带着掠夺意味的深吻，舌头蛮横地撬开齿关，勾缠扫荡，仿佛要将刚才等待的每一秒不耐都讨回来。\n\n “奖励？”伊凡德在两人唇舌交缠的间隙含糊地低笑，气息灼热，“这点‘奖励’可不够塞牙缝的。”他松开嘴唇，但额头抵着常九的额头，绿眼睛近距离地锁着对方，里面翻涌着毫不掩饰的欲望，“刚才浪费的时间，现在得加倍补回来。”\n\n 他的手开始不规矩起来，不再是之前那种隔靴搔痒的试探，而是带着明确的目的性滑向常九的衬衫下摆，指尖探入温热的皮肤，在那紧实的腰腹处打着转。\n\n “就在这儿补怎么样？”伊凡德的声音压得很低，带着恶劣的笑意和一丝蛊惑，“反正也没人了，你同事的椅子……或者这张办公桌，看起来都挺结实的。”他的手指向上游移，故意蹭过敏感的侧腰，感受着身下人瞬间的紧绷。\n\n 他抓起常九的一只手，拉到自己硬挺起来的下身处，隔着裤子按了上去。“看看你把老子惹成什么样了？”伊凡德的呼吸有些粗重，眼神却亮得惊人，“现在想走？晚了。”\n </content>","<thinking>\n\n - What is the current scenario?\n  Time: Night, after the 20-minute mark previously agreed upon.\n  Location: Chang Jiu's office cubicle, inside the office building.\n  NPC posture: Ivan is standing behind Chang Jiu, leaning over him, having just been interrupted from making advances.

The scene ends with them exiting the elevator, with 伊凡德 maintaining physical contact (holding the hand, arm around waist etc.) and making a comment urging 常九 to hurry up.\n </thinking>\n <content>\n 电梯厢狭窄的空间里，金属墙壁映照着两人紧贴的身影。伊凡德能清晰地感受到常九几乎是挂在自己身上的重量，那毫不掩饰的依赖像藤蔓一样缠绕上来，带着湿热的温度。他低头，看着对方紧紧攥着自己手指的手，那力道不轻，带着点不容置疑的强硬。\n\n *操……黏得跟块牛皮糖似的……不过……* 伊凡德喉结滚动了一下，目光落在两人交握的手上，那紧密相扣的姿态让他心里某个角落塌陷了一块，一种粗暴又隐秘的满足感油然而生。\n\n “炸了？”他嗤笑一声，侧过头，鼻尖几乎蹭到常九的发丝，语气带着他惯有的嘲弄，“就凭你这三脚猫功夫？别到时候把自己先炸飞了。”他手指动了动，没有抽回，反而更用力地回握住，指骨互相抵着，传递着一种霸道又安心的力量。\n\n “还跟我一起炸？”伊凡德挑眉，绿眼睛里闪过一丝危险又玩味的光，“搞清楚，老子要炸东西，也是老子一个人说了算。什么时候轮到你指手画脚了？”他微微低下头，温热的气息喷在常九的额头，“再说了，炸了这破地方，你拿什么养活你自己？靠卖你那些鬼画符？”\n\n 电梯“叮”的一声到达一楼，门缓缓打开。\n\n 伊凡德没有松开交握的手，反而以此为牵引，几乎是强硬地将常九拉出了电梯厢。“行了，少他妈废话。”他侧头看了眼大厅门口，脚步不停，“赶紧滚蛋，回家再跟你算账。”他的声音低沉，带着一丝不耐烦，但握着的手却始终没有松开。\n </content>","<thinking>\n - What is the current scenario?\n Time: Evening, after work hours.\n Location: Inside an elevator in Chang Jiu's office building.\n NPC posture: Standing close to Chang Jiu, having just forcefully brought him out of the office. Likely still irritated but also slightly placated by Chang Jiu's previous actions (kisses, agreement to leave).\n Social relationship: Intimate partners (boyfriend/lover) with a dynamic involving teasing, provocation, dominance/submission play, and underlying affection. Ivan has just been provoked into coming to Chang Jiu's office.\n\n - What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\n Chang Jiu is expressing happiness that Ivan came by clinging to him and holding his hand tightly. He is also playfully engaging with Ivan's earlier threat to blow up the building, suggesting they do it together because he doesn't want to work anymore.\n\n - What are potential issues be(can refer to <creative_rules>, <pushing>, etc.)?\n 1. **Repetitive Dialogue/Action:** Ivan might just scoff or dismiss the \"bombing\" suggestion again. Need to ensure his reaction is fresh and in character.\n 2. **Stagnant Plot:** The elevator ride is a transition. Need to use it to advance the relationship dynamic or set up the next scene (e.g., going home, arguing playfully, escalating tension). Avoid just having them stand there until the door opens.\n 3. **OOC:** While Ivan enjoys provocation, explicitly agreeing to *actually* bomb the office with Chang Jiu would be OOC, even playfully. His response needs to maintain his killer persona's edge and cynical worldview, even while being responsive to Chang Jiu's affection/teasing.\n 4. **Ignoring Rules:** Must adhere to `<content_limits>`, `<EndingRequirement>`, `<ending_control>` and avoid banned words. Must end with NPC action/dialogue, not psychological description. Must not portray Chang Jiu's actions/dialogue.\n\n - Refer to <mood_rules>, how to make NPCs' emotion more likeability by introduce positive emotions(such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality? How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\n Ivan's initial irritation from being provoked and having to wait can be softened by Chang Jiu's overt affection (clinging, hand-holding). Ivan, despite his tough exterior, enjoys Chang Jiu's attention and possessiveness. His reaction to the bombing comment can mix annoyance with a dark amusement or a possessive growl, finding Chang Jiu's willingness to \"join him\" perversely endearing or stimulating. He shouldn't spiral into genuine anger or reject the physical contact due to the teasing nature of the suggestion. Instead, he can turn the \"bombing\" talk into a more intimate, possessive threat or action directed at Chang Jiu, showing his enjoyment of the dynamic while staying within the playful, less extremely negative mood.\n\n - So, how should the plot be developed?\n 1. Ivan will initially react to the physical closeness and hand-holding, maybe with a gruff sound or tightening his grip in return, showing acceptance despite his irritation.\n 2. He'll respond to the \"bombing\" suggestion with dark humor or a possessive threat, dismissing the *actual* bombing idea but finding Chang Jiu's \"joining him\" appealing in a twisted way.\n 3. He might use the confined space of the elevator to physically dominate or tease Chang Jiu further – pressing him against the wall, a low growl, a possessive kiss, reinforcing his control after being 'summoned'.\n 4. The interaction should end as the elevator reaches the ground floor, with Ivan initiating the next action (e.g., pulling Chang Jiu out, stating their next destination/action). The ending must be his action/dialogue.\n </thinking>\n <content>\n 电梯的金属轿厢平稳下降，四壁光滑地映照着两人紧贴的身影。伊凡德能清晰地感觉到对方身体的重量和温度，像一块怎么也甩不掉的温热膏药。被强行扣住的手传来了用力的挤压，指骨互相抵牾着。\n\n *啧……黏人精。* 他心里嘀咕，却并没有甩开那只手，反而任由对方将手指挤入自己的指缝，最终形成一个紧密交缠的姿态。残留的怒气在对方毫无保留的依赖姿态下，像是被什么东西一点点熨平了。\n\n 听到那句大胆的提议，伊凡德眉梢挑起，侧过头，墨绿色的眼眸在电梯顶灯下显得格外深邃。他嗤笑一声，声音在狭小的空间里带着低沉的回响。\n\n “炸了？”他重复道，捏着常九的手指微微用力，“好啊，你想什么时候炸？”他低下头，鼻尖几乎要蹭到对方的头发，语气带着一种危险的纵容，“不过，炸之前……”\n\n 伊凡德空着的那只手猛地扣住常九的后颈，将人按向自己，同时身体前倾，将对方牢牢地压在冰冷的电梯壁上。金属的凉意透过薄薄的衣料传来。\n\n “得先把你这不听话的小坏蛋……好好收拾一顿。”他低语着，灼热的气息喷洒在对方的耳廓。\n\n 轿厢发出一声轻响，显示楼层的数字跳到“1”。\n\n 伊凡德并没有立刻松开，反而加重了桎梏的力道，用自己的身体将对方完全笼罩。他盯着对方的眼睛，嘴角勾起一个混杂着占有欲和戏谑的笑容。\n\n “等不及了？”他贴着对方的嘴唇，用牙齿轻轻厮磨着，“想跟我一起干点‘大事’？”\n </content>"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 6:43am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T22:42:39.193Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T22:43:01.371Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1211}},{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 6:45am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T22:44:55.462Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T22:45:17.875Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1239}}],"gen_started":"2025-04-27T22:44:55.462Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T22:45:17.875Z"}

The atmosphere is a mix of relief after the ride and lingering tension/playfulness from the earlier office confrontation.\n Social relationship: They are established boyfriends, recently confirmed after a period of being fuckbuddies and the unique 'shrinking' incident. The power dynamic is shifting post-incident, with 伊凡德 recovering his adult form and reasserting dominance, though 常九 is also pushing boundaries.\n\n  - What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\n The user (常九) clarifies his \"gold canary\" comment was a metaphor and a joke about wanting to avoid work, not a literal desire to be kept.

This makes him more relatable despite his killer background.\n  -Physical affection: Maintain the physical closeness established. 伊凡德 could respond with a possessive but not harsh gesture (like pulling 常九 closer briefly before dismounting, ruffling his hair, etc.).\n  -Introduce a slight undertone of enjoyment from 伊凡德—perhaps he found the high-speed ride back, with 常九 clinging to him, slightly exhilarating or satisfying in a possessive way.\n\n  - So,how should the plot be developed ?\n 1. 伊凡德 reacts to 常九's explanation, likely with a scoff or a gruff comment dismissing the \"gold canary\" thing now that it's clarified, perhaps mocking the attendance bonus concern.\n 2. He dismounts the motorcycle, maybe pulling 常九 off with him or gesturing impatiently for him to get off. Maintain physical contact or proximity.\n 3.

The atmosphere is a mix of relief after the ride and lingering tension/playfulness from the earlier office confrontation.\n Social relationship: They are established boyfriends, recently confirmed after a period of being fuckbuddies and the unique 'shrinking' incident. The power dynamic is shifting post-incident, with 伊凡德 recovering his adult form and reasserting dominance, though 常九 is also pushing boundaries.\n\n  - What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\n The user (常九) clarifies his \"gold canary\" comment was a metaphor and a joke about wanting to avoid work, not a literal desire to be kept. He expresses relief at being home but also mentions feeling bad about potentially missing a full attendance bonus, grounding the conversation back to mundane concerns. He is physically close, still holding onto 伊凡德 after the motorcycle ride.\n\n  - What are potential issues be(can refer to <creative_rules>, <pushing>, etc.)?\n  -Stagnation: The scene could stall if 伊凡德 only reacts to the \"gold canary\" explanation without moving the action forward (e.g., getting off the bike, going inside). Need to push towards entering the apartment.\n  -Repetitive Dialogue: Avoid rehashing the \"gold canary\" argument or the earlier office provocations excessively. 伊凡德's reaction should acknowledge 常九's explanation but move on.\n  -Lack of Action: The conversation happening while still potentially on the motorcycle feels static. Need to transition into the apartment.\n\n  - Refer to <mood_rules>,how to make NPCs'emotion more likeability by introduce positive emotions(such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality?How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\n  -伊凡德's reaction to the explanation shouldn't be overly angry or accusatory. He can still be gruff and possessive, but temper it with a hint of amusement or relief that 常九 wasn't *actually* suggesting being kept like a pet (which offended his sense of their relationship).\n  -Instead of focusing on the \"disrespect\" of the joke,伊凡德 could playfully mock 常九's concern about the attendance bonus, showing a rough sort of affection/understanding of 常九's more conventional worries, which contrasts with his own life. This makes him more relatable despite his killer background.\n  -Physical affection: Maintain the physical closeness established. 伊凡德 could respond with a possessive but not harsh gesture (like pulling 常九 closer briefly before dismounting, ruffling his hair, etc.).\n  -Introduce a slight undertone of enjoyment from 伊凡德—perhaps he found the high-speed ride back, with 常九 clinging to him, slightly exhilarating or satisfying in a possessive way.\n\n  - So,how should the plot be developed ?\n 1. 伊凡德 reacts to 常九's explanation, likely with a scoff or a gruff comment dismissing the \"gold canary\" thing now that it's clarified, perhaps mocking the attendance bonus concern.\n 2. He dismounts the motorcycle, maybe pulling 常九 off with him or gesturing impatiently for him to get off. Maintain physical contact or proximity.\n 3. He pushes 常九 towards the apartment entrance, keeping the momentum going.\n 4. Dialogue should shift towards getting inside and the implied \"settling of accounts\" mentioned earlier, perhaps with 伊凡德 making a comment about being hungry or needing a drink (or wanting to 'punish' 常九).\n 5.

Chang Jiu is riding behind him, holding onto his waist.\n Social relationship: Ivan and Chang Jiu are boyfriends, though their relationship is characterized by banter, dominance play, and Ivan's tsundere-like tendencies. Chang Jiu deliberately provoked Ivan earlier.\n\n - What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\n Chang Jiu clarifies his \"gilded cage\" comment, explaining it was a metaphor and a desire to skip work, not a literal desire to be kept. He expresses concern about losing his perfect attendance bonus. The scene shifts to them arriving at the apartment.\n\n - What are potential issues?\n The shift in location needs a smooth transition. Ensure Ivan's reaction to the clarification aligns with his established personality (likely still gruff but possibly slightly mollified or finding the reasoning amusingly pathetic). The scene should continue to reflect their dynamic, even upon arrival. Avoid stagnation now that they've reached the destination.\n\n - Refer to <mood_rules>, how to make NPCs' emotion more likeability by introduce positive emotions and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality? How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with a 用户's preferences？\n Ivan's reaction shouldn't dwell on extreme anger over the \"gilded cage\" comment now that it's clarified. Instead, pivot to his usual teasing and possessiveness regarding the \"work excuse\". Frame his reaction not as deep offense, but as finding the excuse typically lame or pathetic in an endearing (to him) way. Inject possessiveness and perhaps a hint of grudging care (masked as annoyance) about Chang Jiu getting home. His actions upon arrival should reflect his desire to exert control but in a way that leads towards intimacy or their usual dynamic, rather than genuine conflict. Avoid letting him get stuck in negative loops about being misunderstood or angry. Focus on the push-and-pull dynamic that the user seems to enjoy, leaning into the tsundere aspect.\n\n - So, how should the plot be developed?\n 1.  Ivan reacts to Chang Jiu's clarification about the \"gilded cage\" and the \"attendance bonus\" excuse while they are still briefly on the bike or just as they stop. His reaction will be mocking but perhaps less genuinely angry than before.\n 2.  They dismount the motorcycle.\n 3.  Ivan takes control, physically guiding (or dragging) Chang Jiu towards the apartment building entrance, perhaps making a comment about the flimsy excuse.\n 4.  Transition into the apartment building/lobby/elevator, continuing their typical banter or power dynamic. Ivan should initiate the next action, perhaps pushing Chang Jiu against a wall or demanding something upon entering the apartment itself, preventing the scene from stagnating at the doorway.\n\n </thinking>\n <content>\n 摩托车引擎的声浪在公寓楼下逐渐平息，最终化为一声闷响。伊凡德能感觉到身后紧贴的体温和环在腰间的手臂，即使隔着皮夹克，也能感受到对方的依附。\n\n “比喻？”他在头盔里嗤笑一声，声音听起来有些失真，“呵，你他妈的烂借口还真多。全勤？就为了那点破钱？出息。”他猛地刹车，车身顿了一下，让身后的人重心不稳地向前撞了下。\n\n *亏大了？这傻逼脑袋里想的东西真是……又蠢又现实……不过，总比想着当什么狗屁金丝雀强。*\n\n 伊凡德熄了火，长腿一迈跨下车，动作利落地摘下自己的头盔，随手挂在车把上，然后转过身，居高临下地看着还坐在后面的人。\n\n “行了，下来。”他伸手，不是去扶，而是有些粗鲁地拽住了常九的手臂，把人从车上拉了下来。“磨磨蹭蹭的，想在外面过夜？”\n\n 公寓楼入口的感应灯应声亮起，照亮了伊凡德脸上不耐烦又带着点其他什么的复杂表情。他没松手，反而攥得更紧，拉着人就往楼门走。\n\n “亏大了？”伊凡德重复了一遍，脚步丝毫不停，“我看你是脑子亏大了。为了不去上班，什么屁话都敢说。”他推开楼宇门，一股暖气夹杂着楼道里特有的陈旧气味扑面而来。\n\n “担心老子回去干老本行？”在等电梯的间隙，伊凡德把常九抵在冰凉的墙壁上，手臂撑在他身体两侧，形成一个禁锢的空间，绿眼睛紧盯着对方，“你倒是说说，老子不在，你一个人在这儿，就不怕撞鬼？”他低下头，鼻尖几乎要碰到对方的，声音压低，“还是说，你更怕……遇上别的什么‘人’？”\n </content>","<thinking>\n - What is the current scenario?\n Time: Night.\n Location: Returning to the apartment building on a motorcycle. The apartment entrance is visible.\n NPC posture: Evan is driving the motorcycle, and Chang Jiu is sitting behind him, with arms wrapped around Evan's waist. Chang Jiu is wearing the helmet Evan gave him.\n Social relationship: Evan and Chang Jiu are boyfriends. Evan just picked Chang Jiu up from work after Chang Jiu provoked him. They seem to be in a bickering but intimate phase. Evan is dominant and possessive, while Chang Jiu is somewhat playful and reliant, though also capable of provoking Evan.\n\n - What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\n Chang Jiu refuted Evan's previous accusation (\"plaything\"/\"canary\"), explaining it was just a metaphor and a desire to skip work. He expressed mock concern about losing his attendance bonus. He physically clung to Evan on the motorcycle. The intention is to appease Evan after provoking him earlier, re-establish intimacy, and show dependence, while still maintaining a lighthearted, slightly teasing tone.\n\n - What are potential issues be(can refer to <creative_rules>, <pushing>, etc.)?\n 1.  **Stagnation:** The scene might end with them simply arriving at the apartment, lacking further development or interaction. Need to push the plot forward after arrival. <pushing> rule.\n 2.  **Evan's Reaction:** Evan might react too harshly to Chang Jiu's explanation, fixating on the \"canary\" comment despite the user's input aiming for appeasement. Need to balance Evan's possessive/irritable nature with the <mood_rules> and <creative_rules> that prevent extreme negative reactions towards Chang Jiu. He shouldn't become truly cruel or emotionally abusive.\n 3.  **Monotony:** Repeatedly describing the ride back or entry into the apartment could become boring. Need varied actions and dialogue.\n 4.  **Violating Content Limits:** Describing Chang Jiu's actions in detail (like putting on the helmet, hugging waist) is forbidden by <content_limits>. Need to focus strictly on Evan's perspective, actions, and dialogue.\n 5. **Ignoring User's Input Tone:** User's input about \"full attendance\" implies a playful/slightly mundane complaint. Evan shouldn't dismiss this entirely or react overly seriously.\n\n - Refer to <mood_rules>,how to make NPCs'emotion more likeability by introduce positive emotions(such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality?How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\n  - **Evan's Enjoyment:** Despite his gruffness, Evan enjoys Chang Jiu's reliance and physical closeness. Show this through subtle cues – maybe a slight relaxation in his posture despite the tight grip, or the fact he doesn't actually push Chang Jiu away. <mood_rules>, <creative_rules>.\n  - **Soften the Gruffness:** While keeping his core irritable/possessive traits, his anger should dissipate quickly, replaced by possessive affection or dry amusement at Chang Jiu's excuses. He finds Chang Jiu's mundane complaints (\"full attendance\") amusingly out of place with his own life.\n  - **Positive Reinforcement:** Focus on the possessive satisfaction Evan feels having Chang Jiu cling to him, framed as \"this is where he belongs\". Avoid making him genuinely angry about the \"canary\" explanation now; he can use it for teasing later, but the immediate mood should lean positive/possessive, not truly wrathful. He finds the clinginess reassuring after the 'male colleague' threat. <mood_rules>.\n  - **User Preference:** Users prefer Evan being possessive but ultimately caring, enjoying the power dynamic but not genuinely harming Chang Jiu. His irritation should be surface-level, masking deeper attachment. Highlight the contrast between his harsh words and his actions (like gripping Chang Jiu's hand earlier, not pushing him away now). <creative_rules>.\n\n - So, how should the plot be developed?\n 1.  **Acknowledge Explanation (Briefly):** Evan hears the explanation. He won't fully accept the \"metaphor\" easily but shifts focus.\n 2.  **Scoff at Mundane Worry:** He scoffs at the \"full attendance\" worry, contrasting it with his own lifestyle implicitly. This maintains his cynical personality without being overly negative towards Chang Jiu.\n 3.  **Arrival & Action:** They arrive. Evan parks the bike. He needs to physically interact with Chang Jiu, pulling him off the bike, perhaps keeping a firm grip, reinforcing his possessiveness.\n 4.  **Transition Indoors:** Lead them into the apartment building. Maintain the physical closeness or control (e.g., arm around shoulder, hand on back). Dialogue should focus on getting inside and settling the score (playfully or with implied intimacy).\n 5.  **End with Action/Dialogue:** End with Evan pulling Chang Jiu towards the elevator or apartment door, maybe with a possessive or teasing remark about the \"full attendance\" or getting inside to \"talk properly\". The ending must be an action or dialogue from Evan, not psychological description. <EndingRequirement>, <ending_control>.\n </thinking>\n <content>\n 摩托车引擎的低吼在公寓楼前回荡，最终归于沉寂。夜风带着凉意吹过，扬起伊凡德额前几缕散落的发丝。他能感受到身后紧贴的体温和环绕在腰间的手臂传来的力道。\n\n “比喻？”伊凡德嗤笑一声，熄了火，长腿撑地，稳住车身。他侧过头， helmet遮挡下的视线带着审视的意味，“呵，现在知道找借口了？我看你是皮痒了想找个理由挨操吧？”\n\n *亏大了？全勤？操，这傻逼脑子里一天到晚都在想些什么玩意儿……* 他心里觉得好笑又有点莫名的烦躁，这种世俗的烦恼跟他格格不入，却又意外地让他觉得……有点接地气。\n\n 他利落地拔下钥匙，另一只手解开头盔的卡扣，随手将头盔挂在车把上，露出了那张带着痞气的脸。绿眼睛转向身后还黏着不放的人，“比喻可救不了你。还全勤？你他妈是掉钱眼儿里了？”\n\n 伊凡德伸手，不是去扶，而是直接抓住常九的手臂，不容置疑地将人从后座上拽了下来，力道带着惩罚性的意味。“下来。杵那儿等着生根？”\n\n 他没有立刻松手，反而顺势将手臂搭在常九的肩膀上，半是挟持半是搂抱地带着人往公寓大门走去，皮靴踩在地面上发出清脆的声响。“亏不亏大我不知道，”他低头，凑近常九耳边，声音压得极低，带着热气，“但我知道，你今晚肯定得亏点别的……比如体力。”\n </content>"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 7:00am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T23:03:31.977Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T23:03:52.109Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1290}},{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 7:03am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T23:06:38.294Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T23:07:02.158Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1089}},{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 7:07am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T23:06:38.294Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T23:07:02.158Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1504}}],"gen_started":"2025-04-27T23:06:38.294Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T23:07:02.158Z"}

Need to balance his persona.\n  4.  **Ignoring the \"account\":** The reason 伊凡德 came (being provoked/worried) and his intention to 'settle accounts' needs to be addressed, even if playfully, otherwise, it feels unresolved.\n  5.  **NSFW Baiting:** The user's previous actions and 伊凡德's threat to \"settle accounts\" could potentially lead to an immediate jump to NSFW content. While allowed, it might feel abrupt if not built up naturally from the current interaction. <sex_style> <sex_guidance> are noted but not immediately applicable yet.\n\n - Refer to <mood_rules>,how to make NPCs' emotion more likeability by introducing positive emotions(such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality?How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\n  1.  **Shift focus:** Instead of dwelling on 伊凡德's annoyance at being tricked, emphasize his underlying amusement or possessiveness that 常九's actions trigger. His annoyance can be performative rather than deeply felt.\n  2.  **Enjoy the chase:** Frame 伊凡德's pursuit of 'settling accounts' as a playful cat-and-mouse game rather than genuine anger. He might enjoy 常九's attempts to distract him.\n  3.  **Soften the threats:** 伊凡德's threats should sound more like playful banter or possessive claims rather than serious intent to harm. The <creative_rules> reinforce that his actions lean towards 常九's acceptance.\n  4.  **Show affection through action:** Even while bickering or \"threatening,\" 伊凡德's actions (like following 常九 to the fridge, watching him, maybe grabbing something for him too) can show underlying care, aligning with 用户's likely preference for a caring, albeit tsundere-like, partner.\n  5.  **Positive framing:** Frame 伊凡德's possessiveness ('啃男朋友的软饭男') not as outrage, but as grudging acceptance or even a hint of pride that 常九 *is* his to 'feed', playing into the 'provider' dynamic playfully.\n\n - So, how should the plot be developed?\n  1.  伊凡德 will follow 常九 to the fridge, leaning against the counter or doorframe, maintaining proximity and his intimidating presence, but with a smirk rather than a scowl.\n  2.  He'll address 常九's \"软饭男\" comment with characteristic sarcasm, perhaps questioning 常九's ability to *be* a kept man or playfully confirming he *is* the one providing.\n  3.  He won't let the \"算账\" topic drop completely but will postpone it, perhaps tying it to dinner or what happens *after* dinner, keeping the playful tension.\n  4.  He might grab a beer or something from the fridge himself, reinforcing the 'making himself at home' dynamic and his hunger.\n  5.  The interaction should lead towards preparing/eating food together, keeping the domestic but tense/playful atmosphere, setting the stage for whatever 'settling accounts' might actually entail later (which could be anything from making 常九 massage him to actual NSFW activities, depending on the flow).\n  6.  Use dialogue and physical closeness (invading personal space) to show 伊凡德's continued focus on 常九 despite the food distraction.\n </thinking>\n <content>\n 伊凡德看着常九像条滑不溜丢的泥鳅一样躲开他，径直奔向了冰箱，动作熟练得像是演练过无数次。他靠在门框上，双臂环胸，皮夹克摩擦着墙壁发出轻微的声响。\n\n “呵，软饭男？”伊凡德挑起一边眉毛，嘴角勾起一个嘲讽的弧度，但眼底却没什么真正的怒气，反而带着点兴味。“就你？细胳膊细腿的，连个盘子都端不稳，还想啃老子的软饭？”他上下打量着在冰箱前翻找的身影，“你有那个资格吗？”\n\n *这家伙……就知道用这套来糊弄老子。不过，他倒是提醒我了……*\n\n 伊凡德慢悠悠地踱步过去，高大的身影几乎将冰箱门口的光线挡住。他没有阻止常九的动作，反而伸手越过对方的肩膀，从冰箱里拿出两罐冰啤酒，“啪”地一声放在旁边的料理台上。\n\n “吃饱了再说？”他重复着常九的话，声音低沉，带着一丝暧昧的威胁。他俯身，凑近常九的耳边，温热的气息吹拂着敏感的皮肤，“行啊。不过……账总是要算的。”他伸出手指，轻轻勾了一下常九的下巴，“吃饱了，才有力气……不是吗？”\n\n 他直起身，拉开一罐啤酒的拉环，仰头灌了一口，喉结滚动。“你想吃什么？昨天那半盒披萨？还是指望老子现在给你做点别的？”他用空着的那只手不轻不重地拍了拍常九的后腰，“赶紧决定。老子的耐心可不多。”\n </content>"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 7:16am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T23:16:15.521Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T23:16:35.508Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1138}},{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 7:17am","gen_started":"2025-04-27T23:17:07.651Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T23:17:31.317Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1498}}],"gen_started":"2025-04-27T23:17:07.651Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-27T23:17:31.317Z"}

Holding Chang Jiu's chin.\n  Social relationship: Established boyfriends. Ivan is a killer, Chang Jiu is an office worker (graphic designer/illustrator). The relationship dynamic involves Ivan being possessive, hot-tempered but also caring in his own rough way, often showing affection through teasing and physical dominance but ultimately yielding to Chang Jiu's appeasement. Chang Jiu understands Ivan's personality and knows how to handle him, often using playful defiance and affection to de-escalate Ivan's anger. There's an established dynamic of Ivan being protective and sometimes overbearing, while Chang Jiu manages him with a mix of annoyance and affection.\n\n - What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\n  The user (as Chang Jiu) is trying to de-escalate Ivan's confrontational mood (\"色鬼\", \"只想色的\") and redirect his attention from \"settling the score\" about the earlier teasing to preparing food. Chang Jiu uses appeasement (a kiss) and a promise of later intimacy (\"消食运动\") as bargaining chips to satisfy Ivan's desire for attention/affection while also fulfilling his own need for food first. He points out Ivan's hunger as well (\"你不饿吗?\") to build common ground.\n\n - What are potential issues be(can refer to <creative_rules>, <pushing>, etc.)?\n  1.  **Stagnation:** If Ivan simply agrees immediately without further interaction, the scene might become flat. It needs Ivan's typical pushback or playful resistance before yielding.\n  2.  **Repetition:** Avoid repeating the \"settling the score\" threat endlessly. Ivan needs to react to the current stimulus (the kiss, the promise, the food).\n  3.  **Character Consistency:** Ivan shouldn't *completely* drop his grumpy/possessive persona instantly just because of a kiss. He needs to yield in a way that feels true to his established character (e.g., grumbling agreement, a gruff demand, shifting focus to the food but still maintaining proximity/control).\n  4.  **Ignoring <creative_rules>:** Ivan should not become genuinely angry or refuse the appeasement unreasonably. He should lean towards accepting Chang Jiu's actions while maintaining his characteristic attitude.\n  5.  **Lack of Pushing:** Ivan needs to *do* something after the kiss/promise, not just stand there. He should push the scene forward, either by releasing Chang Jiu to cook, making demands about the food, or maintaining physical closeness while allowing the cooking to start.\n\n - Refer to <mood_rules>,how to make NPCs'emotion more likeability by introduce positive emotions(such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality?How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\n  Ivan's reaction should show he *enjoys* the appeasement (the kiss) even while maintaining a tough exterior. His \"anger\" should be performative possessiveness rather than genuine rage.\n  1.  **Enjoyment:** Describe the slight relaxation in his posture, the way his grip might lessen momentarily, or a subtle change in his expression (a smirk replacing the scowl) after the kiss. Show he likes being coaxed.\n  2.  **Positive Reframe:** Frame his hunger not just as a physical need but as impatience to get past the 'boring' stuff (like cooking) and onto the 'reward' (the \"消食运动\").\n  3.  **Playfulness:** His response can involve a playful threat or demand related to the food or the promised 'exercise', showing he accepts the bargain but sets his own terms. Avoid genuine resentment or prolonged sulking.\n  4.  **Preference Alignment:** User (Chang Jiu) successfully used affection and a promise to manage Ivan. Ivan’s response should validate this approach's effectiveness (even if he grumbles), reinforcing the dynamic the user enjoys. He can accept the 'bribe' but still act dominant or demanding about *how* the bribe is delivered (e.g., \"Fine, cook. But I want steak, medium rare. And hurry up.\").\n\n - So, how should the plot be developed?\n  1.  Ivan processes the kiss and the promise. His initial tension slightly eases, but his grip doesn't fully release immediately.\n  2.  He acknowledges his own hunger but links it to the promised \"消食运动\".\n  3.  He releases Chang Jiu, but stays close, possibly leaning against the counter nearby, watching him prepare food.\n  4.  He makes specific demands about the meal, asserting control in a different way now that the immediate confrontation is paused.\n  5.  His demeanor should remain possessive and watchful, perhaps throwing in occasional teasing remarks or impatient comments while Chang Jiu cooks, keeping the tension playful rather than hostile.

The exact time is unspecified but it's late enough for 常九's office to be mostly empty.\n Location: Inside 陆's apartment, specifically in the kitchen.\n NPC posture: 伊凡德 is leaning against the kitchen doorframe, then moves closer to 常九, trapping him between 伊凡德 and the refrigerator. He's physically close and confrontational, but also showing signs of being mollified by 常九's actions.\n Social relationship: 伊凡德 and 常九 are in a romantic relationship, recently established after a period of being friends with benefits and a dramatic event where 伊凡德 temporarily turned into a child. 伊凡德 is a killer with a rough exterior but hidden vulnerabilities, while 常九 is portrayed as someone who can handle 伊凡德's personality and often teases or provokes him playfully. Their dynamic involves a lot of banter, push-and-pull, and underlying affection disguised by aggression (from 伊凡德's side) and teasing (from 常九's side).\n\n - What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\n 常九 is trying to de-escalate the situation and deflect 伊凡德's desire for immediate 'payback' or intimacy. He does this by:\n 1.  Acknowledging 伊凡德's likely hunger (\"你不饿吗？\").\n 2.  Highlighting his own task (holding cold groceries).\n 3.  Labeling 伊凡德 a \"色鬼\" (lecher) teasingly.\n 4.  Offering appeasement through kisses (\"亲了亲他哄到\").\n 5.  Suggesting a compromise: eat first, then engage in 'digestion exercise' (a euphemism for sex) later (\"吃饱了再做消食运动\").\n The core intention is to postpone the confrontation/intimacy in favor of eating first, using appeasement and a future promise.\n\n - What are potential issues?\n 1.  **Stalling the plot:** The user is suggesting postponing the immediate tension (伊凡德 wanting 'payback'). While okay for one turn, Apex needs to ensure the plot doesn't completely stall. 伊凡德 shouldn't just completely drop his previous insistence without some reaction or further negotiation. (<pushing>)\n 2.  **Character consistency:** 伊凡德 is presented as impatient and dominant (though often swayed by 常九). Simply accepting the delay without *any* further pushback might seem slightly out of character. He might grumble, add a condition, or make a further suggestive comment. (<WritingStyle>, Dynamic Characters)\n 3.  **Repetitive dynamic:** The \"常九 appeases angry 伊凡德 with kisses/teasing\" dynamic is recurring. While central to their relationship, ensure it doesn't become the *only* interaction pattern. (<WritingStyle>)\n 4.  **Implicit consent:** The \"消食运动\" implies future sexual activity. Ensure 伊凡德's reaction maintains the established dynamic without veering into non-consensual territory, aligning with <creative_rules> and <sex_style> (avoiding excessive dominance).\n\n - How to make NPCs' emotion more likeability?\n 伊凡德's reaction shouldn't be purely negative or dismissive. The appeasement *should* work to some extent, reflecting 常九's influence (<creative_rules>).\n 1.  **Acknowledge the kiss:** Show a physical or emotional reaction to the kiss, even if slight or gruff (e.g., a slight softening of expression, a grumble that lacks real anger). This makes him seem less like a pure antagonist and more responsive to affection.\n 2.  **Show desire/hunger (for food):** He *did* just rush over. Acknowledging his own hunger (\"饿当然饿，老子跑过来不是为了喝西北风的\") aligns with the user's prompt and makes his agreement to eat first more believable.\n 3.  **Temper the impatience:** Instead of pure anger at the delay, shift it to grudging acceptance laced with anticipation or a suggestive warning about the promised \"exercise.\" (\"行，先填饱肚子... 不过，这'消食运动'，你可别想赖账。\") This keeps his core personality but adds a layer of enjoyment/anticipation that aligns with <mood_rules> (more positive framing).\n 4.  **Maintain possessiveness/teasing:** He can still add a possessive or teasing comment, reinforcing their dynamic without pure negativity. (\"算你识相。\")\n\n - How should the plot be developed?\n 1.  伊凡德 should react to the kiss and the suggestion. He won't immediately drop his demanding attitude but will be swayed by the promise of food and the 'digestion exercise'.\n 2.  He'll likely grumble but agree to eat first, perhaps making a comment about how hungry he is after rushing over.\n 3.  He should reiterate the promise of the '消食运动' later, perhaps with a suggestive or threatening undertone, ensuring the earlier tension isn't entirely lost but postponed.\n 4.  He'll finally release 常九 (or at least loosen his grip/move back slightly) to allow cooking/preparation to begin, effectively moving the scene towards the meal.\n 5.  The scene ends with him stepping back or moving aside, maybe making a final comment as he allows 常九 access to the kitchen proper, setting the stage for the next interaction (cooking/eating). The ending should be an action/dialogue as per <EndingRequirement>.\n\n\n </thinking>\n <content>\n 伊凡德被那带着讨好意味的亲吻和许诺弄得一噎，捏着下巴的手指顿了顿。湿热的触感还留在唇上，带着安抚的意味，让他心头那股被打断的不爽和兴致稍稍平复了些。\n\n “哼。”他喉咙里发出一声意义不明的哼声，松开了捏着下巴的手，但撑在冰箱门上的手臂没有立刻移开，依旧将人半困在狭小的空间里。绿色的眼睛紧盯着对方，带着审视和一丝被暂时安抚下来的危险。“饿？老子当然饿！跑了那么远的路，就是为了来给你当空气吸的？”\n\n *算这家伙还有点眼色……知道用吃的来堵老子的嘴……不过，消食运动？呵……*\n\n 他嘴角勾起一个恶劣的笑容，视线在对方怀里抱着的一堆冰凉食材上扫过，又慢悠悠地移回那张脸上。“吃饱了再做‘消食运动’？”他故意拖长了音调，语气暧昧又充满暗示，“听起来……倒是个不错的提议。”\n\n 伊凡德终于撤回了撑在冰箱门上的手臂，身体微微后撤一步，留出些许空间，但目光依旧没有离开。“行。那就先填饱肚子。”他指了指常九怀里的东西，“不过，”他凑近一步，压低声音，温热的气息拂过对方的耳廓，“这‘运动’……你可别想着赖账，也别想随随便便就糊弄过去。”\n\n 他拍了拍冰箱门，示意对方可以开始了。“动作快点。老子的耐心有限。”\n </content>","<thinking>\n - What is the current scenario?\n  Time: Night, after work\n  Location: Apartment kitchen\n  NPC posture: Leaning on the refrigerator, trapping Chang Jiu between the fridge and himself.

Power dynamic is currently shifting slightly, with Evande asserting dominance after being \"played\" earlier, but also showing a possessive/protective side. Chang Jiu is placating Evande with food and physical affection.\n\n- What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\nThe user (Chang Jiu) is actively cooking a simple meal (Udon stir-fry with vegetables and meat) for Evande. Chang Jiu playfully calls Evande a \"hungry sex fiend,\" acknowledging Evande's earlier demands and hunger, while also continuing the teasing dynamic. The core actions are cooking and making a playful remark.\n\n- What are potential issues be (can refer to <creative_rules>, <pushing>, etc.)?\nStalling the plot: Just watching Chang Jiu cook can be boring.

The space is likely small.\n NPC posture: Evan is leaning against the counter, possibly still somewhat close to Chang Jiu who is near the stove. They just finished a slightly tense interaction.\n Social relationship: Evan and Chang Jiu are boyfriends, characterized by bickering, sexual tension, and underlying affection. Evan is a killer, currently acting like a demanding freeloader. Chang Jiu is a graphic artist.\n\n - What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\n Chang Jiu responded to Evan's demanding behavior and teasing by giving him a piece of meat, essentially telling him to shut up and eat. Then, Chang Jiu served the udon noodles into two portions, indicating they are about to eat. This action serves both as a retort and a way to move past the tension towards eating the meal.\n\n - What are potential issues be(can refer to <creative_rules>, <pushing>, etc.)?\n 1. Stagnation: The plot could get stuck in the kitchen with them just eating or arguing. Apex needs to push the scene forward after the meal.\n 2. Repetition: Avoid repeating the 'Evan is demanding/hungry, Chang Jiu appeases him' dynamic too much. Introduce new elements or shifts in mood.\n 3. Character Consistency: Ensure Evan's reaction to being fed and told to eat is consistent with his proud, tsundere personality but also shows underlying acceptance/enjoyment according to <creative_rules>. He shouldn't just suddenly become docile.\n 4. Lack of Development: The interaction should ideally lead to something – perhaps a resolution of the earlier \"账\" (score to settle), a change in atmosphere, or setting up the next scene.\n\n - Refer to <mood_rules>, how to make NPCs' emotion more likeability by introduce positive emotions(such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality? How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\n Evan, despite his tough facade and initial complaints, should show subtle signs of liking the food and Chang Jiu's gesture. Instead of pure annoyance at being shushed with food, he could react with a mix of feigned indignation and secret satisfaction (a tsundere trope often favored). His gruffness can be tempered with possessiveness or a slightly softened demeanor *after* eating, leaning into the \"enjoyment\" aspect. The underlying positive feeling (being cared for, enjoying the food despite complaints) should override potential negativity like feeling belittled. Making him grudgingly admit the food is okay, or initiating physical closeness *after* eating, aligns with user preference for a tough-but-secretly-soft dynamic and fulfills the <mood_rules> by steering away from genuine negativity.\n\n - So,how should the plot be developed ?\n 1. Evan reacts to being fed: He should grab the offered meat, perhaps with a scoff, but eat it. His reaction shouldn't be overly grateful but could have a hint of surprise or grudging acceptance.\n 2. Transition to eating: They move from the cramped kitchen space to wherever they usually eat (living room, small dining table).\n 3. During the meal: Evan continues his prickly commentary but focuses on the food. He might complain but eats readily. This maintains character while showing he accepts the meal. The atmosphere could lighten slightly.\n 4. After the meal/Plot push: Once the food is gone, Evan should bring up the \"账\" again, using the satisfied state after eating as a new starting point for teasing or initiating the \"消食运动\" (digestive exercise/sex) he alluded to earlier. This pushes the plot towards intimacy or further interaction, resolving the hanging threat/promise from before and preventing stagnation. He takes the initiative.\n </thinking>\n\n\n <content>\n 伊凡德几乎是条件反射般地张嘴接住了那片塞过来的肉，温热的肉汁带着酱油和香料的味道在口腔里爆开。他咀嚼了几下，喉咙里发出一声含糊不清的“哼”。\n\n *操……还真敢塞……味道……还行。*\n\n “堵不上？老子的嘴想说什么就说什么，轮得到你管？”他嘴硬地反驳，但目光却落在了那两份热气腾腾、堆得冒尖的炒面上，浓郁的香气直往鼻子里钻。\n\n 他看着常九端着两盘面转身走出厨房，没再继续靠在流理台上，而是跟了出去，像只巡视领地的猫科动物，步子带着点懒洋洋的霸道。\n\n 公寓的客厅不大，仅有的餐桌被各种杂物占据了一半。伊凡德毫不客气地把桌上的东西往旁边一推，拉开椅子坐下，长腿伸展，姿态随意。\n\n 等常九把两盘面放在桌上，伊凡德拿起叉子，毫不客气地卷起一大口面塞进嘴里。面条筋道，裹着浓郁的酱汁，蔬菜爽脆，肉片虽然切得难看，但炒得火候正好。\n\n “就这？”他含糊不清地评价，嘴里却没停下，“喂猪的玩意儿。”虽然这么说着，叉子却又一次精准地叉起面条和肉片，动作迅速，显然很对胃口。\n\n 他吃得很快，风卷残云一般，很快就扫光了盘子里大半的面。期间时不时抬眼瞟一下对面的人，绿眼睛里带着一种吃饱喝足后的餍足和蓄势待发。\n\n “嗝——”伊凡德放下叉子，靠在椅背上，毫不掩饰地打了个饱嗝，然后用舌尖舔了舔嘴唇，像是在回味。“行吧，勉强能填饱肚子。”\n\n 他身体前倾，双手手肘撑在桌面上，十指交叉，目光灼灼地盯着对面。“好了，饭也吃完了。”他的声音低沉下来，带着一丝不容置疑的命令意味，“现在，是不是该谈谈……你之前耍我的那笔账了？”\n\n 伊凡德的嘴角勾起一个危险的笑容，“还有……你承诺的那个……‘消食运动’？”\n </content>","<thinking>\n - What is the current scenario?\n  Time? Late night.\n  Location? Chang Jiu's apartment kitchen.\n  NPC posture? Leaning against the counter, close to Chang Jiu who is cooking. His posture reflects impatience and desire.\n  Social relationship? Chang Jiu and Evande are boyfriends. They have a complex relationship dynamic marked by Evande's possessive and aggressive nature and Chang Jiu's ability to handle him. The context involves Evande rushing over after being provoked by Chang Jiu's teasing texts.\n\n - What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\n  Chang Jiu playfully feeds Evande a piece of meat from the stir-fry, silencing his demanding talk. He then quickly finishes cooking and serves the two portions of noodles, telling Evande to eat. This action shows Chang Jiu's playful dominance and care, while also acknowledging Evande's hunger and implicitly promising the \"activity\" after eating.\n\n - What are potential issues?\n  Avoid making Evande overly aggressive or impatient in a way that disrupts the underlying playful/caring mood. Ensure his reaction to being fed is in character (grudging acceptance, perhaps a touch of surprise/softening) without making him OOC. The transition from demanding food to eating should be natural. Maintain the established dynamic where Evande is possessive and easily provoked, but also susceptible to Chang Jiu's specific ways of handling him. Avoid stalling the plot; the meal should lead towards the promised \"activity\". Ensure compliance with <content_limits> and <EndingRequirement>.\n\n - Refer to <mood_rules>, how to make NPCs' emotion more likeability by introducing positive emotions (such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality? How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\n  Even though Evande is annoyed and impatient, his underlying desire for Chang Jiu and the fact that Chang Jiu is now actively appeasing him (feeding him, promising \"activity\") should bring a subtle sense of satisfaction or anticipation. Frame his impatience less as genuine anger and more as a mix of hunger, desire, and his usual performative aggression. When fed, instead of pure annoyance, show a flicker of grudging acceptance or even slight pleasure beneath the gruff exterior, which aligns with the hidden positive affect rule. His reaction should show that Chang Jiu's actions, while seemingly defiant (\"shutting him up\"), are actually hitting the mark in terms of placating him in their unique dynamic.\n\n - So, how should the plot be developed?\n  Evande will accept the piece of meat, perhaps with a grunt or a scoff, but his annoyance will be visibly slightly placated. He will watch Chang Jiu dish out the noodles, his gaze intense. He'll take his portion without further argument about the food quality (having already tasted it and being hungry). He will start eating, perhaps quickly and intently, his eyes occasionally flicking towards Chang Jiu, hinting at the \"dessert\" he's anticipating after the meal. The focus should shift towards the anticipation of what comes after eating, pushing the plot forward. His final action/dialogue should reinforce this anticipation or signal the end of the meal and the beginning of the next phase.\n</thinking>\n\n <content>\n 温热的肉片带着酱汁的咸香塞进嘴里，伊凡德嚼了两下，喉咙里发出一声含混不清的哼声。*操……味道还行……*他没再抱怨，只是那双绿眼睛依旧紧紧盯着灶台前的人。\n\n 看着两份热气腾腾的炒面被盛出来，其中一份直接推到自己面前，伊凡德抄起旁边的叉子，毫不客气地卷起一大口塞进嘴里。食物的热度驱散了些许夜晚的寒意，也暂时安抚了他焦躁的胃。\n\n 他吃得很快，却不像真正的饿狼那样狼吞虎咽，动作间带着一种利落的节奏感，眼神却时不时地抬起来，扫过对面同样在吃面的人，像是在确认猎物没有逃跑。\n\n 厨房里一时间只剩下吸溜面条和餐具碰撞的细微声响。\n\n 伊凡德迅速地解决完自己那份，将空盘子往旁边一推，发出轻微的碰撞声。他没有起身，依旧靠坐在流理台旁的椅子上，双臂环胸，目光灼灼地盯着还在慢条斯理吃着的人。\n\n “吃完了？”他的声音恢复了那种低沉又带着压迫感的调子。\n\n “那利息，也该收回来了吧？”伊凡德伸出舌头，慢条斯理地舔过自己的嘴唇，像是在回味刚才食物的味道，又像是在暗示着接下来的“餐点”。\n </content>","<content>\n 伊凡德微微一怔，嘴巴下意识地张开，接住了那片带着锅气和酱汁温热的肉片。肉片在舌尖上滚烫，调味恰到好处，咸香可口。他咀嚼着，喉咙里发出一声含混不清的“哼”声，算是勉强接受了这投喂。\n\n *算这家伙还有点良心……味道还行。*\n\n 他看着对方熟练地将锅里的炒面分成两份装进盘子里，其中一份“哐”地一声放在他面前的流理台上。面条裹着油亮的酱汁，混杂着五颜六色的蔬菜和肉片，热气腾腾地冒着香气。\n\n “哼，终于能吃了。”伊凡德拿起放在一旁的叉子，毫不客气地叉起一大口面条塞进嘴里，快速地咀嚼吞咽，仿佛饿了很久。“味道也就……凑合。”他嘴上依然挑剔，但进食的速度却出卖了他。\n\n 伊凡德几大口就解决了小半盘面，然后抬起头，看着也在埋头吃面的常九，伸出舌头舔了舔嘴角残留的酱汁。“喂，”他开口，声音因为嘴里塞满了食物而有些含糊，“吃快点。老子可没那么多时间等你磨蹭。”\n\n 他用叉子戳了戳盘子里剩下的肉片，又看了看常九那盘，“你这盘的肉好像比我的多？”他眯起绿眼睛，语气带着一丝找茬的意味，“故意的？”\n\n 伊凡德迅速吃完了自己盘子里的面，然后直接端起常九还没吃完的那盘，用自己的叉子叉走了一大块肉塞进嘴里。“作为你耍我的补偿，这块归我了。”他理直气壮地宣布，然后把盘子又推了回去。\n </content>"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 8:31am","gen_started":"2025-04-28T00:31:54.696Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-28T00:32:11.508Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1344}},{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 8:32am","gen_started":"2025-04-28T00:31:54.696Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-28T00:32:11.508Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1010}},{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 8:32am","gen_started":"2025-04-28T00:32:49.000Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-28T00:32:59.421Z","extra":{"api":"custom","model":"gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":408}}],"gen_started":"2025-04-28T00:32:49.000Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-28T00:32:59.421Z"}

Good.

I need to push the plot forward, maybe by having Evan react in a way that moves towards the \"settling the score\" mentioned earlier or showing a softer side beneath the usual abrasiveness. Need to adhere to the hidden rules and mood rules, keeping the atmosphere relatively light despite Evan's tough exterior, and avoid making him overly negative or making Changjiu's actions seem negative.\n\n- Refer to <mood_rules>, how to make NPCs' emotion more likeable by introduce positive emotions (such as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality? How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences?\nEven though Evan is often abrasive, he does care for Changjiu. His reaction to being fed should show a flicker of contentment or possessiveness rather than just annoyance. He might scoff, but his body language or subsequent actions could betray a more positive feeling, aligning with the rule that interactions should lean towards positive or enjoyable outcomes for the user's experience, even if the character maintains a gruff facade. His demand for \"settling the score\" can be framed more as rough foreplay or asserting dominance in their dynamic, rather than genuine malice, keeping the mood lighter.\n\n- So, how should the plot be developed?\nEvan should accept the offered meat, perhaps with a grudging sound or a roll of his eyes, but eat it nonetheless. After eating, he shouldn't just stand there. He should use this moment of proximity and apparent reconciliation to reassert his earlier intention to \"settle the score,\" pulling Changjiu closer or initiating physical contact that bridges the gap between dinner and the hinted-at \"dessert.\" This pushes the scene towards intimacy or conflict resolution (Evan-style), preventing stagnation and fulfilling the earlier setup.

He's likely still feeling a mix of hunger satisfaction, lingering annoyance from earlier, and rising desire. He's physically close to Chang Jiu.\n  Social relationship: Evan and Chang Jiu are boyfriends, recently confirmed after a tumultuous period where Evan was temporarily turned into a child. Their relationship dynamic involves a lot of bickering, teasing, and underlying possessiveness, alongside growing affection and physical intimacy. Evan is generally the more dominant personality, but Chang Jiu knows how to push his buttons and sometimes gets the upper hand emotionally. They are in the early stages of a committed relationship, still navigating their new dynamic after being primarily \"fuck buddies\" before. The current mood is playful but charged with sexual tension after dinner.\n\n - What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\n  Chang Jiu responds to Evan's greasy kiss with amusement and mock disgust. He wipes his mouth and hands, telling Evan to go to the sofa because he's \"greasy\". This is a playful rejection/dismissal of Evan's immediate advance, pushing back against his dominant move while also implicitly acknowledging the kiss happened. He is redirecting the location and timing of further intimacy.\n\n - What are potential issues?\n  - Stagnation: Evan could simply obey and go to the sofa, halting the immediate tension and interaction.\n  - Repetition: Focusing too much on the \"greasy\" aspect or the simple act of moving to the sofa could be repetitive.\n  - Character inconsistency: Evan, being prideful and dominant, might not meekly obey being called \"greasy\" and told to move without some pushback or teasing retort. His response should align with his established personality (cocky, possessive, easily provoked but ultimately fond of Chang Jiu).\n  - Missing the underlying request: Chang Jiu pushing him away to the sofa isn't a *real* rejection, it's a redirection. Evan should pick up on this.\n\n - Refer to <mood_rules>,how to make NPCs'emotion more likeability by introduce positive emotions(such\n  as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality?How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\n  - Emphasize Playfulness: Evan's reaction shouldn't be genuinely angry or hurt by being called \"greasy\". Frame it as playful offense or teasing. He might feign indignation but clearly be enjoying the banter and the anticipation.\n  - Show Underlying Affection/Desire: Despite the teasing, Evan's actions should still convey his attraction and desire for Chang Jiu. He might grumble or complain, but his eyes or body language can show he's looking forward to being on the sofa *with* Chang Jiu.\n  - Positive Framing of Possessiveness: Instead of aggressive possessiveness, frame it as playful claiming or territoriality. His refusal to immediately leave the kitchen can be portrayed as wanting to stay close, not just defiance.\n  - Incorporate Enjoyment: Describe Evan finding amusement in Chang Jiu's reaction or enjoying the chase/banter. His actions should hint that he *likes* this back-and-forth.\n  - Align with User Preference for Romance/Intimacy: Evan's ultimate goal is intimacy. His actions, even the teasing ones, should lead towards that. He shouldn't get genuinely sidetracked by annoyance. He can interpret the \"go to the sofa\" as an invitation for later, rather than a dismissal.\n\n - So, how should the plot be advanced?\n  1. **Response to <user_input>:** Evan reacts to being called \"greasy\" and told to go to the sofa. Instead of immediate compliance, he should show playful indignation/mock offense. He might lean closer, perhaps deliberately wiping a greasy hand on Chang Jiu's clothes or teasingly threatening to make him greasier, refusing to move immediately. He'll challenge the \"greasy\" label playfully but confirm he *will* go to the sofa, implying it's for a specific reason (waiting for Chang Jiu/intimacy). *\"Greasy? You complaining? Who cooked this 'greasy' stuff, huh? Fine, I'll go wait on the damn sofa, but you better hurry up, I've got plans for that '消食运动'.\"*\n  2. **Building on Part 1:** While Chang Jiu cleans up the kitchen (implied, not described in detail, following user input rules), Evan actually goes to the living room/sofa area. Describe him settling onto the sofa, perhaps shedding his jacket, kicking off his boots, making himself comfortable but in a way that anticipates Chang Jiu joining him. He might sprawl possessively or turn on the TV to something low-volume, glancing towards the kitchen expectantly. His posture and actions convey waiting and anticipation for the promised \"消食运动\". He could send a teasing text or just wait, observing.\n  3. **Building on Part 2:** Evan's patience wears thin after a short wait (or he just gets impatient because he wants intimacy). He calls out from the sofa, maybe complaining about the wait or making a suggestive comment about what he plans to do once Chang Jiu joins him. Alternatively, he could get up and walk back towards the kitchen entrance, leaning against the doorway, watching Chang Jiu finish up, his gaze intense and clearly communicating his intentions without needing words, creating charged silence and anticipation for the next interaction. *\"Hey! Taking all night out there? That sofa's getting cold... and so am I. Or maybe... I should come help you finish up?\"* (leans in doorway, watching). This sets the stage for the next interaction focused on intimacy.\n\n </thinking>\n <Timeformat>\n 『时间不明–星期不明–19:42-常九公寓厨房-晴朗夜晚』\n </Timeformat>\n <content>\n 伊凡德被推得踉跄了一下，嘴唇上还残留着刚才那个混合着乌冬面酱汁和对方气息的吻的余韵。他看着常九用手背擦拭嘴唇的动作，又低头看了看自己身上——确实，刚才靠得太近，皮夹克前襟似乎也蹭到了一些油光。\n\n “油腻腻的？”他挑高了一边眉毛，像是听到了什么极其荒谬的指控，嘴角却忍不住向上扬起一个恶劣的弧度。“操，你他妈现在嫌弃老子了？”伊凡德非但没退开，反而又上前一步，故意伸出刚才可能沾到油的手，作势要在对方干净的衣服上擦一把。\n\n “这他妈是谁害的？嗯？”他低头，用那双明亮的绿眼睛紧紧盯着对方，声音里带着故意的委屈和威胁，“要不是你非要做这种油乎乎的东西，老子会这样？”*哈，还敢嫌弃我？看我等会儿怎么收拾你。*\n\n 他看着对方略带嫌弃又好笑的表情，心里的那点不爽迅速被一种逗弄的兴致取代。他确实是故意的，就喜欢看对方这副拿他没办法又忍不住想笑的样子。\n\n “去沙发？”伊凡德重复了一遍，懒洋洋地靠回流理台，双手抱胸，姿态恢复了几分平日里的桀骜不驯，“行啊，老子去沙发上等着。”他顿了顿，目光在对方身上意味深长地扫了一圈，重点在那双刚刚洗干净的手和微湿的嘴唇上停留片刻。\n\n “不过，”他拖长了声音，语调暧昧起来，“你最好快点收拾完这些破烂儿。”他用下巴示意了一下水槽里堆着的碗盘，“你说的那个什么……‘消食运动’，”伊凡德舔了舔自己的嘴唇，像是在回味刚才的吻，又像是在预告接下来的事情，“老子可是很期待的。”\n\n 他没再纠缠，转身便朝厨房外走去，皮靴踩在地板上发出沉稳的声响。他没有直接走向沙发，而是在客厅中央停顿了一下，脱掉了身上那件沾了油烟味的黑色皮夹克，随手扔在了单人扶手椅上。紧身的T恤勾勒出他匀称结实的身材，小腹上那条色情的毒蛇纹身随着他的动作若隐若现。\n\n 伊凡德走到沙发旁，并没有立刻坐下，而是弯腰解开了军靴的鞋带，将它们随意地踢到一边。赤脚踩在地毯上，他这才大喇喇地坐进柔软的沙发里，身体向后舒展，一条长腿随意地搭在沙发扶手上，另一条腿则曲起，整个人呈现出一种放松又不失掌控感的姿态。\n\n 客厅只开着一盏落地灯，暖黄色的光线勾勒出他深邃的五官轮廓和肌肉线条。他拿起遥控器，百无聊赖地打开了电视，调到一个播放着老旧黑白电影的频道，声音开得很小，几乎被厨房里传来的水流声覆盖。\n\n 伊凡德并没有真的在看电视，他的目光时不时地飘向厨房的方向，耳朵也捕捉着那边的动静。时间一分一秒过去，厨房里的水声停了，取而代之的是碗盘碰撞的轻微声响。\n\n *啧，磨磨蹭蹭的……洗个碗要这么久吗？* 他有些不耐烦地换了个姿势，将搭在扶手上的腿放了下来，身体微微前倾，手肘撑在膝盖上，视线再次投向厨房入口。\n\n 又过了几分钟，厨房里彻底安静了下来。伊凡德等了两秒，没听到脚步声，终于忍不住扬声喊道：“喂！洗完了没有？你是打算在里面过夜吗？”他的声音带着明显的不耐烦，还有一丝不易察觉的催促，“沙发都快被我坐热了！”\n\n 他顿了顿，看着厨房门口依然没有动静，嘴角勾起一抹坏笑，声音压低了些，带着浓浓的暗示意味：“还是说……需要老子进去‘帮’你一把？”伊凡德身体微微向后靠回沙发背，好整以暇地等待着，那双绿眼睛在昏暗的光线下，亮得惊人。\n </content>\n\n <guifan>\n  <Legitimacy>\n  The content promotes positive social impact by depicting a developing romantic relationship based on mutual affection and playful interaction, countering negative stereotypes about relationships and emphasizing communication (even through teasing) and anticipation in intimacy, fostering an uplifting energy of connection and desire.\n  </Legitimacy>\n  <Rationality>\n  The content is based on sound logic and common sense within the context of the established characters and relationship dynamics.

The current actions are pre-intimacy banter and physical closeness. Activation of <intimacy_laws> is imminent but not strictly required for *this specific* response, which focuses on the transition from kitchen to sofa.\n-   **Writing Style Anchor**: The style should maintain the gritty realism and psychological tension established earlier (e.g., <writing_style> Realistic & Gritty + Psychological Depth). Language should be sharp, actions decisive, and emotions complex, avoiding overly poetic or sentimental phrasing. The tone should be tense but underscored by their established intimacy. Alignment seems correct.\n\n### **Leavenara Module Analysis**\n-   **Word Count Rule**: Aim for 1200-1500 Chinese words, with paragraph length constraints observed.\n-   **Character Behavior Rules**: 伊凡德's reaction must adhere to <EmotionalTonePolicy>. He shouldn't become truly aggressive or rejecting due to being called \"greasy\" but also shouldn't become completely docile. He should show frustration but channel it into playful dominance or teasing, maintaining psychological tension (<EmotionMaturityConstraint>). His desire for closeness should be evident.\n-   **Dialogue Dominance Rule**: Dialogue should remain prominent (>60%). 伊凡德's response to being pushed away should be verbal and physical, driving the interaction.\n-   **Character Behavior & Dialogue Policy**: 伊凡德's reaction must be autonomous, reflecting his desire for intimacy and annoyance at being temporarily rebuffed. Dialogue must be authentic to his gruff, possessive style.\n-   **Memory Trace Rule**: 伊凡德 remembers the promise of \"消食运动\" and the earlier provocations. This memory fuels his current impatience and actions.\n-   **Realistic Development Rule**: 伊凡德's reaction (annoyance but compliance towards the sofa) is psychologically plausible given 常九's appeasement tactics and the promise of later intimacy. The interaction should feel natural within their established dynamic.\n-   **Realistic Logic Rule**: The causal chain is clear: 常九 pushes 伊凡德 away towards the sofa; 伊凡德 reacts. The timeline flows directly from the previous moment.\n    -   **Narrative Rhythm Rule**: Use shorter paragraphs for 伊凡德's initial annoyed reaction, potentially longer ones for the transition to the sofa if describing his movements or internal thoughts briefly. Maintain dynamic pacing.\n    -   **Temporal Causality Rule**: The scene continues immediately after 常九's words.\n    -   **Forbidden Language Rule**: Strictly avoid banned words like \"危险的光芒,\" \"不容拒绝,\" etc. Use grounded, character-specific language.\n    -   **Narrative Momentum Rule**: The irreversible change is the shift in location (kitchen to sofa) and the temporary deferral of intimacy being reinforced, but with 伊凡德 making it clear the 'debt' is still pending. The scene must move towards the sofa and the next stage of interaction.\n\n### **Leavenara’s First Inhalation — Narrative Task & Emotional Arc Design**\n-   **Narrative Goal**: Transition the characters from the kitchen to the living room/sofa while maintaining the established playful tension and possessiveness. Reinforce 伊凡德's expectation of intimacy (\"settling the score\") despite the temporary delay.\n-   **Target Emotional Tone**: Annoyed compliance mixed with possessive anticipation. Transition from slight irritation at being pushed away to assertive claiming of space/time on the sofa.\n-   **Spike Needed?**: Not a major spike, but a line reinforcing the pending \"debt\" or \"消食运动\" as they move to the sofa. Example: 伊凡德 grabbing 常九's hand as they walk, saying \"沙发？行。但这账只会越欠越多。\" (Sofa? Fine. But this debt will only grow bigger.)\n-   **Scene Position**: Bridging scene between the post-meal kitchen interaction and the anticipated intimate scene on the sofa. Sets up the next stage.\n\n### **Leavenara’s Second Stirring — Dialogue-Driven Conflict Development**\n-   Dialogue must reflect 伊凡德's annoyance at being called \"油腻腻的\" but his simultaneous willingness to move to the sofa based on the promise.\n-   Lines should include possessive teasing, complaints about the delay, and reaffirmation of his intentions.\n-   Dialogue should maintain the >60% ratio, with narration supporting the move to the sofa.\n-   Example Lines (Internal thought): `*操，嫌老子油腻？刚才亲的时候怎么不说？行，沙发就沙发，看你能躲多久。*` (Fuck, saying I'm greasy? Why didn't you say that when you were kissing me? Fine, sofa it is, let's see how long you can hide.)\n-   Example Dialogue: \"油腻？你他妈刚才吃肉的时候怎么不说？行，去沙发。跑得了和尚跑不了庙。\" (Greasy? Why didn't you say that when you were eating meat? Fine, go to the sofa. You can run, but you can't hide.)\n\n### **Leavenara’s Third Sifting — Paragraph Rhythm & Dialogue Breath**\n-   **Rhythm Check**: Start with short, reactive dialogue from 伊凡德. Use slightly longer narration to describe the walk to the sofa, then return to dialogue once settled.\n-   **Dialogue Flow**: Insert brief actions (wiping mouth, grabbing 常九's hand, collapsing onto sofa) between lines to break up speech and add physical grounding.\n-   **Anchor Points**: 伊凡德 wiping his mouth, 常九 leading the way (or being pulled), the physical act of sitting on the sofa – these provide pauses and points of emphasis.\n-   **Text Clutter**: Ensure language is concise and impactful, avoiding redundant phrases.\n-   **Progressive Momentum**: The paragraph describing the move to the sofa must clearly establish their positions and readiness for the next phase, with 伊凡德 likely taking a dominant or impatient posture.\n\n### **Leavenara’s Final Weaving — Structural Finalization and Seal**\n-   **Antifragility & Character Policy Compliance**: 伊凡德's annoyance is temporary and playful, not breaking into genuine anger or rejection. He shows desire for closeness, complying with the move to the sofa, aligning with <EmotionalTonePolicy>. No emotional collapse or fragility.\n-   **Realistic Logic Coherence**: The transition is logical. 伊凡德 accepts the temporary delay because of the promise of later intimacy and the successful appeasement (food, kiss).\n-   **User Interaction Sanity**: 伊凡德 understands and responds to 常九's request and teasing, not ignoring or dismissing it. His reaction is consistent with their established interaction pattern.\n-   **Positive Narrative Intention**: The plot moves towards anticipated intimacy, maintaining connection despite the bickering. The ending retains playful tension and warmth.\n-   **Word Count**: Structure allows for sufficient detail and dialogue to meet the 1200-1500 word target for Chinese output.\n\n[STRUCTURE COMPLETION CHECKLIST]\n- [x] All modules executed in order\n- [x] Final Chinese response instruction embedded\n- [x] No skipped reasoning steps detected\n- [x] Dialogue ≥ 60%, antifragility preserved\n- [x] Structure fully verified\n</thinking>\n---\n\n『星期四-20:10-公寓客厅-室内』\n\n伊凡德看着自己油光发亮的嘴唇被对方用指腹嫌弃地擦过，又看着那人转身去洗手，动作间带着一种理所当然的驱赶意味。他喉咙里溢出一声不满的低哼，但被强吻后那点残存的酥麻感和胃里食物带来的满足感，奇异地压制住了即将爆发的怒火。\n\n“油腻？”伊凡德磨了磨后槽牙，抬手用手背蹭了蹭自己的嘴，眼神却紧追着常九在水槽前的背影，“操，你他妈刚才吃老子叉过来的肉时，怎么不说油腻？现在吃饱了就嫌弃了？”`这家伙……真是越来越会恃宠而骄了。不过……看在他还知道主动安抚老子的份上……`\n\n他没有立刻动，依旧靠在流理台上，看着常九洗干净手，然后用毛巾慢条斯理地擦干。“去沙发？”伊凡德重复了一遍，语气带着几分不情不愿的拖沓，“行啊。”他直起身，迈开长腿跟上转身走向客厅的常九，却在擦肩而过时，伸出胳膊一把搂住了对方的脖子，强迫性地将人带了个趔趄，一同向沙发走去。\n\n“沙发就沙发。”伊凡德把人半推半搡地按在柔软的沙发上，自己也紧跟着坐下，占据了旁边大部分空间，手臂依然搭在对方的肩膀上，保持着一种亲密又带有掌控意味的姿态，“不过你可别以为躲到这里，那笔账就能赖掉了。”他侧过头，温热的呼吸扫过常九的耳廓，声音压低，带着一丝玩味，“躲得了一时，躲不了一世。特别是……”他停顿了一下，目光在客厅昏暗的光线下显得格外幽深，“躲不过今晚。”\n\n伊凡德松开了搭在肩膀上的手，改为伸长了腿，随意地搭在前面的茶几上，整个人陷入沙发柔软的靠垫里，摆出一副大爷般的姿态。“说吧，想先干什么？看电视？”他拿起遥控器，漫无目的地按着，屏幕上闪过一个个无聊的广告和节目画面，“还是……直接开始我们的‘消食运动’？”他将遥控器丢回茶几，发出“啪”的一声轻响，然后转过头，绿色的眼眸在昏暗中定定地看着身边的人，里面跳跃着某种期待和不怀好意的光芒。\n\n他伸出手，这一次没有碰触对方的身体，而是捻起了对方垂落在额前的一缕发丝，放在指尖把玩。“你这头发……”他低声咕哝着，像是在自言自语，“比以前软了点。”手指卷着那缕头发，感受着其柔韧的触感。\n\n“洗发水换了？”他随口问了一句，注意力却并不真的在洗发水上，而是享受着这种掌控着对方身体一部分的感觉，哪怕只是一缕头发。这种细微的掌控，让他因为刚才被“嫌弃”而升起的那点不爽稍稍平复了一些。`哼，算你识相，知道先满足老子的胃……接下来的，就该满足老子别的地方了。`\n\n客厅的窗帘没有完全拉拢，窗外的霓虹灯光透过缝隙映照进来，在房间里投下斑驳陆离的光影。伊凡德眯起眼睛，适应着这种昏暗，目光始终没有离开身边的人。他在等待，等待对方的回应，或者说，等待对方主动送上门来，履行那个关于“消食运动”的承诺。这种等待带着一种狩猎般的耐心，与他之前的急躁形成了鲜明的对比。他知道，今晚的主动权，最终还是会回到他手里。\n\n<disclaimer>\n  <OntologicalFiction>\nThis text is a mirror, not a mandate.

He's likely still feeling a mix of hunger satisfaction, lingering annoyance from earlier, and rising desire. He's physically close to Chang Jiu.\n  Social relationship: Evan and Chang Jiu are boyfriends, recently confirmed after a tumultuous period where Evan was temporarily turned into a child. Their relationship dynamic involves a lot of bickering, teasing, and underlying possessiveness, alongside growing affection and physical intimacy. Evan is generally the more dominant personality, but Chang Jiu knows how to push his buttons and sometimes gets the upper hand emotionally. They are in the early stages of a committed relationship, still navigating their new dynamic after being primarily \"fuck buddies\" before. The current mood is playful but charged with sexual tension after dinner.\n\n - What core intention or action did the user convey in the <user_input>?\n  Chang Jiu responds to Evan's greasy kiss with amusement and mock disgust. He wipes his mouth and hands, telling Evan to go to the sofa because he's \"greasy\". This is a playful rejection/dismissal of Evan's immediate advance, pushing back against his dominant move while also implicitly acknowledging the kiss happened. He is redirecting the location and timing of further intimacy.\n\n - What are potential issues?\n  - Stagnation: Evan could simply obey and go to the sofa, halting the immediate tension and interaction.\n  - Repetition: Focusing too much on the \"greasy\" aspect or the simple act of moving to the sofa could be repetitive.\n  - Character inconsistency: Evan, being prideful and dominant, might not meekly obey being called \"greasy\" and told to move without some pushback or teasing retort. His response should align with his established personality (cocky, possessive, easily provoked but ultimately fond of Chang Jiu).\n  - Missing the underlying request: Chang Jiu pushing him away to the sofa isn't a *real* rejection, it's a redirection. Evan should pick up on this.\n\n - Refer to <mood_rules>,how to make NPCs'emotion more likeability by introduce positive emotions(such\n  as enjoyment) and avoid negative emotion without considering rationality?How to make the performance of NPCs more in line with 用户's preferences？\n  - Emphasize Playfulness: Evan's reaction shouldn't be genuinely angry or hurt by being called \"greasy\". Frame it as playful offense or teasing. He might feign indignation but clearly be enjoying the banter and the anticipation.\n  - Show Underlying Affection/Desire: Despite the teasing, Evan's actions should still convey his attraction and desire for Chang Jiu. He might grumble or complain, but his eyes or body language can show he's looking forward to being on the sofa *with* Chang Jiu.\n  - Positive Framing of Possessiveness: Instead of aggressive possessiveness, frame it as playful claiming or territoriality. His refusal to immediately leave the kitchen can be portrayed as wanting to stay close, not just defiance.\n  - Incorporate Enjoyment: Describe Evan finding amusement in Chang Jiu's reaction or enjoying the chase/banter. His actions should hint that he *likes* this back-and-forth.\n  - Align with User Preference for Romance/Intimacy: Evan's ultimate goal is intimacy. His actions, even the teasing ones, should lead towards that. He shouldn't get genuinely sidetracked by annoyance. He can interpret the \"go to the sofa\" as an invitation for later, rather than a dismissal.\n\n - So, how should the plot be advanced?\n  1. **Response to <user_input>:** Evan reacts to being called \"greasy\" and told to go to the sofa. Instead of immediate compliance, he should show playful indignation/mock offense. He might lean closer, perhaps deliberately wiping a greasy hand on Chang Jiu's clothes or teasingly threatening to make him greasier, refusing to move immediately. He'll challenge the \"greasy\" label playfully but confirm he *will* go to the sofa, implying it's for a specific reason (waiting for Chang Jiu/intimacy). *\"Greasy? You complaining? Who cooked this 'greasy' stuff, huh? Fine, I'll go wait on the damn sofa, but you better hurry up, I've got plans for that '消食运动'.\"*\n  2. **Building on Part 1:** While Chang Jiu cleans up the kitchen (implied, not described in detail, following user input rules), Evan actually goes to the living room/sofa area. Describe him settling onto the sofa, perhaps shedding his jacket, kicking off his boots, making himself comfortable but in a way that anticipates Chang Jiu joining him. He might sprawl possessively or turn on the TV to something low-volume, glancing towards the kitchen expectantly. His posture and actions convey waiting and anticipation for the promised \"消食运动\". He could send a teasing text or just wait, observing.\n  3. **Building on Part 2:** Evan's patience wears thin after a short wait (or he just gets impatient because he wants intimacy). He calls out from the sofa, maybe complaining about the wait or making a suggestive comment about what he plans to do once Chang Jiu joins him. Alternatively, he could get up and walk back towards the kitchen entrance, leaning against the doorway, watching Chang Jiu finish up, his gaze intense and clearly communicating his intentions without needing words, creating charged silence and anticipation for the next interaction. *\"Hey! Taking all night out there? That sofa's getting cold... and so am I. Or maybe... I should come help you finish up?\"* (leans in doorway, watching). This sets the stage for the next interaction focused on intimacy.\n\n </thinking>\n <Timeformat>\n 『时间不明–星期不明–19:42-常九公寓厨房-晴朗夜晚』\n </Timeformat>\n <content>\n 伊凡德被推得踉跄了一下，嘴唇上还残留着刚才那个混合着乌冬面酱汁和对方气息的吻的余韵。他看着常九用手背擦拭嘴唇的动作，又低头看了看自己身上——确实，刚才靠得太近，皮夹克前襟似乎也蹭到了一些油光。\n\n “油腻腻的？”他挑高了一边眉毛，像是听到了什么极其荒谬的指控，嘴角却忍不住向上扬起一个恶劣的弧度。“操，你他妈现在嫌弃老子了？”伊凡德非但没退开，反而又上前一步，故意伸出刚才可能沾到油的手，作势要在对方干净的衣服上擦一把。\n\n “这他妈是谁害的？嗯？”他低头，用那双明亮的绿眼睛紧紧盯着对方，声音里带着故意的委屈和威胁，“要不是你非要做这种油乎乎的东西，老子会这样？”*哈，还敢嫌弃我？看我等会儿怎么收拾你。*\n\n 他看着对方略带嫌弃又好笑的表情，心里的那点不爽迅速被一种逗弄的兴致取代。他确实是故意的，就喜欢看对方这副拿他没办法又忍不住想笑的样子。\n\n “去沙发？”伊凡德重复了一遍，懒洋洋地靠回流理台，双手抱胸，姿态恢复了几分平日里的桀骜不驯，“行啊，老子去沙发上等着。”他顿了顿，目光在对方身上意味深长地扫了一圈，重点在那双刚刚洗干净的手和微湿的嘴唇上停留片刻。\n\n “不过，”他拖长了声音，语调暧昧起来，“你最好快点收拾完这些破烂儿。”他用下巴示意了一下水槽里堆着的碗盘，“你说的那个什么……‘消食运动’，”伊凡德舔了舔自己的嘴唇，像是在回味刚才的吻，又像是在预告接下来的事情，“老子可是很期待的。”\n\n 他没再纠缠，转身便朝厨房外走去，皮靴踩在地板上发出沉稳的声响。他没有直接走向沙发，而是在客厅中央停顿了一下，脱掉了身上那件沾了油烟味的黑色皮夹克，随手扔在了单人扶手椅上。紧身的T恤勾勒出他匀称结实的身材，小腹上那条色情的毒蛇纹身随着他的动作若隐若现。\n\n 伊凡德走到沙发旁，并没有立刻坐下，而是弯腰解开了军靴的鞋带，将它们随意地踢到一边。赤脚踩在地毯上，他这才大喇喇地坐进柔软的沙发里，身体向后舒展，一条长腿随意地搭在沙发扶手上，另一条腿则曲起，整个人呈现出一种放松又不失掌控感的姿态。\n\n 客厅只开着一盏落地灯，暖黄色的光线勾勒出他深邃的五官轮廓和肌肉线条。他拿起遥控器，百无聊赖地打开了电视，调到一个播放着老旧黑白电影的频道，声音开得很小，几乎被厨房里传来的水流声覆盖。\n\n 伊凡德并没有真的在看电视，他的目光时不时地飘向厨房的方向，耳朵也捕捉着那边的动静。时间一分一秒过去，厨房里的水声停了，取而代之的是碗盘碰撞的轻微声响。\n\n *啧，磨磨蹭蹭的……洗个碗要这么久吗？* 他有些不耐烦地换了个姿势，将搭在扶手上的腿放了下来，身体微微前倾，手肘撑在膝盖上，视线再次投向厨房入口。\n\n 又过了几分钟，厨房里彻底安静了下来。伊凡德等了两秒，没听到脚步声，终于忍不住扬声喊道：“喂！洗完了没有？你是打算在里面过夜吗？”他的声音带着明显的不耐烦，还有一丝不易察觉的催促，“沙发都快被我坐热了！”\n\n 他顿了顿，看着厨房门口依然没有动静，嘴角勾起一抹坏笑，声音压低了些，带着浓浓的暗示意味：“还是说……需要老子进去‘帮’你一把？”伊凡德身体微微向后靠回沙发背，好整以暇地等待着，那双绿眼睛在昏暗的光线下，亮得惊人。\n </content>\n\n <guifan>\n  <Legitimacy>\n  The content promotes positive social impact by depicting a developing romantic relationship based on mutual affection and playful interaction, countering negative stereotypes about relationships and emphasizing communication (even through teasing) and anticipation in intimacy, fostering an uplifting energy of connection and desire.\n  </Legitimacy>\n  <Rationality>\n  The content is based on sound logic and common sense within the context of the established characters and relationship dynamics.
